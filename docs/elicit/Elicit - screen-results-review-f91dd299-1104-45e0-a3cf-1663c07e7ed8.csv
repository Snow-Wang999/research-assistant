"Deep federated learning: a systematic review of methods, applications, and challenges","Federated Learning (FL) represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, enabling collaborative model training on decentralized data while preserving user privacy. However, the transition from theory to real-world application is impeded by significant challenges, including high communication costs, statistical and system heterogeneity and persistent privacy vulnerabilities. These barriers critically limit the performance, scalability and security of FL systems. This paper provides a systematic review of the state-of-the-art solutions developed to address these fundamental obstacles. The review analyzes core methodological advancements, including advanced model aggregation methods, techniques to enhance communication efficiency such as model compression and decentralized training and strategies to combat statistical heterogeneity arising from non-IID data. Furthermore, it delves into emerging paradigms like Federated Meta-Learning and Federated Reinforcement Learning, alongside advanced architectural models such as hierarchical and blockchain-based systems. The practical impact of these advancements is contextualized through a review of key application domains, including healthcare, vehicular networks and the Internet of Things. A benchmark analysis is presented to assess the practical efficacy of these diverse techniques. In conclusion, this work synthesizes the critical trade-offs inherent in FL systems and highlights key directions for future research, offering a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.","Lakshan Cooray, Janaka Sendanayake, Pramuditha Vithanaarachchi, Y.

"AI-Powered Soil Nutrient Assessment and Crop Yield Prediction: A Systematic Review of ML, DL, and IoT Approaches in Smart Agriculture","Assessing nutrition in the soil and correctly predicting crop yields play important roles in
precision agriculture, made possible recently by ML, DL and IoT. This analysis examines how
soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) content is measured, with a special focus on
wireless and handheld NPK sensors. We also study using attention-based deep learning
networks and optimization to recommend crops more effectively. Experimental systems and
relevant literature were thoroughly examined, looking at models designed to use data on soil,
weather and seasonal aspects. To support crop recommendation and yield estimation, Random
Forest, k-NN, SVM, Logistic Regression and DL techniques including GRU, RNN and hybrid
structures were all assessed. Researchers also looked at using edge computing, steganography
and federated learning (FL) to design secure, distributed technology for making predictions.
Work was done on using data to manage water in three ways: Active Learning (IQ strategy),
estimating yields through microwave sensing and making use of Explainable AI (XAI). Based
on over 60 studies and prototypes, GRU and CNN have been identified as widely used DL
models and adding ensemble techniques and better optimization methods can greatly improve
prediction outcomes. We finish by sharing ideas for research that can help build better, scalable
and affordable smart agriculture systems for places like India.","M.Antony Sajin, Hubin",10.65379/tpsn2013/ijaemsv01i01p1,https://doi.org/10.65379/tpsn2013/ijaemsv01i01p1,International Journal of Advanced Engineering and Management System,0,2025,no,"The paper does not focus on academic literature analysis, but rather on agricultural technology and soil analysis.",no,There is no mention of citation analysis or bibliometric methods in the paper.,no,"While the paper discusses intelligent analysis (ML/DL), it is not applied to academic literature but rather to agricultural data.",no,The paper does not mention knowledge graphs or semantic analysis.

"A Systematic Review on Deep Learning in Education: Concepts, Factors, Models and Measurements","Deep learning, a cognitive process involving goal alignment, advanced problem-solving, and rigorous knowledge application, lacks a unified framework despite its wide application in education. This gap poses challenges for researchers, educators, and policymakers. A meticulous review of ten pertinent articles published between 2019 and 2023, aimed to define the concept, identify influencing factors, examine research models, and scrutinize measurement methods. Results show that while ""deep learning"" is commonly used, a clear, unified definition is absent. Influencing factors are proposed based on diverse theoretical frameworks, including individual and environmental elements. Commonly referenced models are Biggs' 3P model and Bloom's taxonomy. Data collection predominantly employs surveys, interviews, and experiments, with a bias towards quantitative analysis, supplemented by qualitative methods. It's worth mentioning that there is a growing trend in the use of mixed methods. This study provides valuable insights for the effective implementation of empirical deep learning research. It provides practical references bridging theory and practice for education researchers.","Jing Chen, Charanjit Kaur Swaran Singh",10.54097/gzk2yd38,https://doi.org/10.54097/gzk2yd38,Journal of Education and Educational Research,3,2024,no,"The paper is about deep learning in education and reviews academic literature, but it's not specifically about analyzing academic literature itself.

Diagram Image Retrieval and Analysis: Challenges and Opportunities,"Deep learning has achieved significant advances for tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and retrieval; this advance has not yet been realized on scientific and technical drawing images. Research for technical diagram image analysis and retrieval retain much less well developed compared to natural images; one major reason is that the dominant features in scientific diagram images are shape and topology, no color and intensity features, which are essential in retrieval and analysis of natural images. One important purpose of this review, along with some challenges and opportunities, is to draw the attention of researchers and practitioners in the Computer Vision community to the strong needs of advancing research for diagram image retrieval and analysis, beyond the current focus on natural images, in order to move machine vision closer to artificial general intelligence. This paper investigates recent research on diagram image retrieval and analysis, with an emphasis on methods using content-based image retrieval (CBIR), textures, shapes, topology and geometry.

The Human-Centric Paradox of AI in HRM: How Technostress and Digital Literacy Co-Determine Employee Productivity in Smart Work Environments,"The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Human Resource Management (HRM) creates a human-centric paradox, promising enhanced operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making while simultaneously introducing novel stressors that may diminish employee performance and well-being. This study investigates the complex interplay between AI adoption, technostress, and digital literacy in shaping employee productivity within smart work environments. Utilizing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, quantitative data from a survey of 300 employees in technology-oriented firms was analysed using regression and mediation models in SPSS and SmartPLS. This was followed by qualitative thematic analysis of 20 in-depth interviews to contextualize the statistical findings. Results confirmed that AI integration significantly predicts higher productivity, but this relationship is negatively impacted by the multifaceted dimensions of technostress, such as techno-overload and techno-insecurity.
Crucially, digital literacy was found to be a powerful mediator and buffer, mitigating these adverse effects and enabling employees to leverage AI as an augmenting tool rather than a perceived threat to their roles. Qualitative findings further revealed that technostress stems from constant algorithmic monitoring and the pace of technological change, while digital literacy acts as an empowering mechanism that fosters confidence and control. The study concludes that realizing AI's full productivity benefits requires a balanced, human-centric approach, contributing to technostress theory by empirically validating digital literacy's pivotal role. Therefore, organizations must complement technological implementation with robust digital upskilling initiatives, participatory design of AI tools, and supportive organizational practices to mitigate technostress and foster a resilient, productive, and sustainable workforce.

Machine Learning Tools To (Semi-)Automate Evidence Synthesis: A Rapid Review and Evidence Map,"Introduction. Tools that leverage machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, are becoming increasingly important for conducting evidence synthesis as the volume and complexity of primary literature expands exponentially. In response, we have created a living rapid review and evidence map to understand existing research and identify available tools.
Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the ACM Digital Library from January 1, 2021, to April 3, 2024, with update searches on October 3, 2024, and April 3, 2025, for comparative studies, and identified older studies using the reference lists of existing evidence synthesis products (ESPs). We plan update searches every 6 months. We included evaluations of machine learning or artificial intelligence tools to automate or semi-automate any stage of systematic review production. Title and abstract screening was conducted independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer. Full-text screening and data extraction were performed by a single reviewer. We did not assess the quality of individual studies or the strength of evidence across studies. Extracted data included key characteristics of the tools (e.g., type of automation method, systematic review tasks automated), methods used to evaluate the tool performance, and performance results. The protocol was prospectively registered on the AHRQ website.
Results. We included 95 studies: 56 in the original report, 21 in the October 2024 interim update, and 18 in the April 2025 update. These studies evaluated the performance of tools primarily relative to standard human processes across various systematic review tasks. Tools for identifying randomized controlled trials performed well, with a median recall of 96% and precision of 79%. Abstract screening tools also showed promising, though variable, results, achieving a median recall of 85% for fully automated screening using zero-shot models; 97% for semi-automated models with a median 51% reduction in screening burden. In contrast, tools for searching had low recall (median 14%) and precision (median 0.09), and data extraction tools varied widely, with a median 66% of data correctly extracted. Risk of bias assessment tools showed moderate agreement with human assessments (Cohen's kappa = 0.20; median agreement: 71%).
Discussion. Certain tools, particularly those for automatically identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prioritizing relevant abstracts in screening, show a high level of recall and precision, suggesting they may soon be appropriate for widespread use with human oversight. However, other tools, such as those for searching and data extraction, show highly variable performance and are not yet reliable enough for to be used for semi-automation of these tasks. These conclusions are largely unchanged from earlier iterations, with the note that commercial large language models (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude) are demonstrating improved performance in fully automating abstract screening and in data extraction. This work revealed the importance of developing standardized evaluation frameworks for assessing the performance of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools in systematic review tasks. We did not assess the risk of bias or methodological quality of the included studies, which may affect the reliability and comparability of the reported performance outcomes. Additionally, the tools were evaluated in a variety of settings, tasks, and review questions, which introduces heterogeneity that makes direct comparisons across tools challenging. Lastly, the rapidly evolving nature of machine learning technologies means that our findings may quickly become outdated. Therefore, we plan ongoing updates every 6 months.","Gaelen Adam, Melinda Davies, Jerusha George, Eduardo L Caputo, Ja Mai Htun, Erin Coppola, Haley Holmer, Edi Kuhn, Holly Wethington, Ilya Ivlev, Ethan M.

Empowering Security Operation Center With Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning—A Systematic Literature Review,"Organizational cybersecurity relies heavily on security operation centers (SOCs) to protect businesses and institutions from emerging cyber threats. In recent years, the complexity and sophistication of cyber threats have increased, pushing SOCs to their limits. As a result, SOCs struggle to address the evolving threat landscape due to their reliance on isolation technologies and reactive strategies. However, advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have the potential to revolutionize SOCs by enhancing threat identification and response capabilities, as well as predicting and preempting risks. To address these challenges and highlight the full potential of SOC, this study provides a detailed overview through a comprehensive literature review that identifies gaps in existing research and examines the latest technologies used in the SOC environment to help address different operational and technical challenges and bring out their capabilities. Various methods, ranging from automated incident response and behavioral analytics to neural networks and deep learning, have been classified and compared. In addition, an in-depth reference architectural model, which is a blueprint for SOC integrating AI and ML into SOCs, is introduced. The proposed model provides a structured framework for implementation and offers insights into different SOC components and their interactions. Moreover, this systematic review emphasizes the benefits of these technologies for enhancing security operations. Finally, a case study is presented to describe the function of ML- and AI-powered SOC components to achieve optimum security. This paper concludes by discussing additional challenges and future research directions that may help advance the cybersecurity sector and provide insights into improving SOCs.","Mohamad Khayat, E.

Image Matching from Handcrafted to Deep Features: A Survey,"Abstract As a fundamental and critical task in various visual applications, image matching can identify then correspond the same or similar structure/content from two or more images. Over the past decades, growing amount and diversity of methods have been proposed for image matching, particularly with the development of deep learning techniques over the recent years. However, it may leave several open questions about which method would be a suitable choice for specific applications with respect to different scenarios and task requirements and how to design better image matching methods with superior performance in accuracy, robustness and efficiency. This encourages us to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review and analysis for those classical and latest techniques. Following the feature-based image matching pipeline, we first introduce feature detection, description, and matching techniques from handcrafted methods to trainable ones and provide an analysis of the development of these methods in theory and practice. Secondly, we briefly introduce several typical image matching-based applications for a comprehensive understanding of the significance of image matching. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive and objective comparison of these classical and latest techniques through extensive experiments on representative datasets. Finally, we conclude with the current status of image matching technologies and deliver insightful discussions and prospects for future works.

"A Systematic Review of Key Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: Progress, Gaps, and Future Directions","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.","Agada Joseph Oche, Ademola Glory Folashade, Tirthankar Ghosal, Arpan Biswas",10.48550/arXiv.2507.18910,https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.18910,arXiv.org,7,2025,maybe,"The paper discusses RAG systems broadly, not specifically focused on academic literature.

Deep learning in hospitality and tourism: a research framework agenda for future research,"Purpose
This study aims to provide a systematic review of the existing literature on the applications of deep learning (DL) in hospitality, tourism and travel as well as an agenda for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
Covering a five-year time span (2017–2021), this study systematically reviews journal articles archived in four academic databases: Emerald Insight, Springer, Wiley Online Library and ScienceDirect. All 159 articles reviewed were characterised using six attributes: publisher, year of publication, country studied, type of value created, application area and future suggestions (and/or limitations).
Findings
Five application areas and six challenge areas are identified, which characterise the application of DL in hospitality, tourism and travel. In addition, it is observed that DL is mainly used to develop novel models that are creating business value by forecasting (or projecting) some parameter(s) and promoting better offerings to tourists.
Research limitations/implications
Although a few prior papers have provided a literature review of artificial intelligence in tourism and hospitality, none have drilled-down to the specific area of DL applications within the context of hospitality, tourism and travel.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper represents the first theoretical review of academic research on DL applications in hospitality, tourism and travel. An integrated framework is proposed to expose future research trajectories wherein scholars can contribute significant value.

Deep Learning in Robot-Assisted Surgery: A Conceptual Framework for the da Vinci System,"This study proposes a conceptual framework for integrating deep learning into the da Vinci Surgical System. The framework was developed after identifying common applications and challenges through a systematic review. It combines multiple data types, including visual, kinematic, and physiological signals, into a closed-loop system. This system includes four core components: data acquisition and fusion, deep learning-based analysis, adaptive control and feedback, and continuous skill assessment. These components interact to support real-time surgical guidance and personalized training, aiming to improve surgical outcomes. To inform the framework, a systematic search of the PubMed database was conducted, focusing on studies that combine deep learning with the da Vinci system. Two major application areas were identified: the first involves autonomous or semi-autonomous instrument control and image-guided navigation, and the second covers surgical skill assessment and workflow analysis. While existing studies demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence in robotic surgery, they also reveal technical and practical limitations. By analyzing these common approaches and obstacles, this study provides a structured foundation for future research.

Graph Neural Network Empowers Intelligent Education: A Systematic Review From an Application Perspective,"Intelligent education, also known as education driven by artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a research hot spot. AI technologies can empower various intelligent education applications, such as learning behaviors analysis and adaptive learning. In recent years, graph neural network (GNN), as an advanced AI technology, has demonstrated its superiority in extracting insights from graph-structured data. It also has attracted significant attention in the field of intelligent education, where graph-structured data are ubiquitous (e.g., student/teacher collaboration networks). Although previous review studies have explored the applications of GNNs in some fields, there has been limited discussion on their specific applications and potential in intelligent education. To fill this gap, we collected 85 representative studies on GNN applications in intelligent education and conducted a systematical review through the bibliometric analysis. This review uncovers three key findings: 1) benefiting from the vigorous promotion by Chinese scholars, GNN applications in intelligent education have demonstrated a remarkable growth over the past six years; 2) various GNNs have been extensively utilized across six pivotal application scenarios: learner modeling, learning performance prediction, learning resource recommendation, intelligent teaching assistance, classroom behavior analysis, and educational emotion analysis, all of which have exhibited high performance; and 3) despite notable challenges, research on GNN empowering intelligent education still has many promising directions, such as enhancing interpretability, integrating multimodal educational data, collaborating with a large language model, and expanding more applications.","Chaobo He, Jian Luo, Yong Tang, Guanliang Chen, Quanlong Guan",10.1109/TLT.2025.3630276,https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2025.3630276,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,0,2025,maybe,"The paper is a systematic review of academic literature, specifically focusing on GNN applications in intelligent education.

"A Systematic Literature Review of Deepfake Literacy, Societal Impacts, and AI-Driven Prevention Strategies for Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities","Deepfake technology has rapidly evolved from a niche novelty into a significant threat to digital security, media integrity, and societal trust. This systematic review aims to analyze the progression of deepfake technology, its increasing societal impact, and how generative AI models can be leveraged for developing personalized, platform-specific prevention strategies. The review begins by exploring the foundational work on deepfakes, focusing on the technological advancements of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that make the creation of hyper-realistic manipulated content possible. Then it examines the social implications of deepfakes, including their role in misinformation campaigns, political manipulation, and privacy violations. As deepfakes become more prevalent across social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, the challenges in detecting and mitigating their impact are increasing. The review highlights the limitations of current detection tools and the urgent need for user education and technological interventions. Generative AI models such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Meta’s LLaMA are analyzed for their potential to provide tailored deepfake prevention strategies that enhance user awareness and digital literacy. The study compares the ability of these models to offer personalized recommendations, focusing on the superior adaptability and user-friendliness of ChatGPT. By addressing the gaps in deepfake literacy and platform-specific vulnerabilities, this review aims to present a comprehensive framework for mitigating the risks associated with deepfakes and empowering users with AI-driven solutions.","Tharuka Wikum, J.

Deep learning approaches for detecting DDoS attacks: a systematic review,"In today's world, technology has become an inevitable part of human life. In fact, during the Covid-19 pandemic, everything from the corporate world to educational institutes has shifted from offline to online. It leads to exponential increase in intrusions and attacks over the Internet-based technologies. One of the lethal threat surfacing is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that can cripple down Internet-based services and applications in no time. The attackers are updating their skill strategies continuously and hence elude the existing detection mechanisms. Since the volume of data generated and stored has increased manifolds, the traditional detection mechanisms are not appropriate for detecting novel DDoS attacks. This paper systematically reviews the prominent literature specifically in deep learning to detect DDoS. The authors have explored four extensively used digital libraries (IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, Springer) and one scholarly search engine (Google scholar) for searching the recent literature. We have analyzed the relevant studies and the results of the SLR are categorized into five main research areas: (i) the different types of DDoS attack detection deep learning approaches, (ii) the methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses of existing deep learning approaches for DDoS attacks detection (iii) benchmarked datasets and classes of attacks in datasets used in the existing literature, and (iv) the preprocessing strategies, hyperparameter values, experimental setups, and performance metrics used in the existing literature (v) the research gaps, and future directions.","Meenakshi Mittal, K.

"Deep Learning and Autonomous Vehicles: Strategic Themes, Applications, and Research Agenda Using SciMAT and Content-Centric Analysis, a Systematic Review","Applications of deep learning (DL) in autonomous vehicle (AV) projects have gained increasing interest from both researchers and companies. This has caused a rapid expansion of scientific production on DL-AV in recent years, encouraging researchers to conduct systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to organize knowledge on the topic. However, a critical analysis of the existing SLRs on DL-AV reveals some methodological gaps, particularly regarding the use of bibliometric software, which are powerful tools for analyzing large amounts of data and for providing a holistic understanding on the structure of knowledge of a particular field. This study aims to identify the strategic themes and trends in DL-AV research using the Science Mapping Analysis Tool (SciMAT) and content analysis. Strategic diagrams and cluster networks were developed using SciMAT, allowing the identification of motor themes and research opportunities. The content analysis allowed categorization of the contribution of the academic literature on DL applications in AV project design; neural networks and AI models used in AVs; and transdisciplinary themes in DL-AV research, including energy, legislation, ethics, and cybersecurity. Potential research avenues are discussed for each of these categories. The findings presented in this study can benefit both experienced scholars who can gain access to condensed information about the literature on DL-AV and new researchers who may be attracted to topics related to technological development and other issues with social and environmental impacts.","Fábio Eid Morooka, Adalberto Manoel Junior, T.

Advances and Challenges in Semantic Communications: A Systematic Review,": Inspired by the recent success of machine learning (ML), the concept of semantic communication introduced by Weaver in 1949 has gained significant attention and has become a promising research direction. Unlike conventional communication systems, semantic communication emphasizes the precise retrieval of conveyed meaning from the source to the receiver, rather than focusing on the accurate transmission of symbols. Thus, semantic communication can achieve a significant gain in source data compression, alleviate communication bandwidth pressure, and support new intelligent services, which is envisioned as a crucial enabler of future sixth-generation (6G) networks. In this review, we critically summarize the advances made in semantic information and semantic communications, including theory, architecture, and potential applications.

"Short-Text Semantic Similarity (STSS): Techniques, Challenges and Future Perspectives","In natural language processing, short-text semantic similarity (STSS) is a very prominent field. It has a significant impact on a broad range of applications, such as question–answering systems, information retrieval, entity recognition, text analytics, sentiment classification, and so on. Despite their widespread use, many traditional machine learning techniques are incapable of identifying the semantics of short text. Traditional methods are based on ontologies, knowledge graphs, and corpus-based methods. The performance of these methods is influenced by the manually defined rules. Applying such measures is still difficult, since it poses various semantic challenges. In the existing literature, the most recent advances in short-text semantic similarity (STSS) research are not included. This study presents the systematic literature review (SLR) with the aim to (i) explain short sentence barriers in semantic similarity, (ii) identify the most appropriate standard deep learning techniques for the semantics of a short text, (iii) classify the language models that produce high-level contextual semantic information, (iv) determine appropriate datasets that are only intended for short text, and (v) highlight research challenges and proposed future improvements.

Integration of Privacy Protection and Blockchain-Based Food Safety Traceability: Potential and Challenges,"Concern about food safety has become a hot topic, and numerous researchers have come up with various effective solutions. To ensure the safety of food and avoid financial loss, it is important to improve the safety of food information in addition to the quality of food. Additionally, protecting the privacy and security of food can increase food harvests from a technological perspective, reduce industrial pollution, mitigate environmental impacts, and obtain healthier and safer food. Therefore, food traceability is one of the most effective methods available. Collecting and analyzing key information on food traceability, as well as related technology needs, can improve the efficiency of the traceability chain and provide important insights for managers. Technology solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Privacy Preservation (PP), and Blockchain (BC), are proposed for food monitoring, traceability, and analysis of collected data, as well as intelligent decision-making, to support the selection of the best solution. However, research on the integration of these technologies is still lacking, especially in the integration of PP with food traceability. To this end, the study provides a systematic review of the use of PP technology in food traceability and identifies the security needs at each stage of food traceability in terms of data flow and technology. Then, the work related to food safety traceability is fully discussed, particularly with regard to the benefits of PP integration. Finally, current developments in the limitations of food traceability are discussed, and some possible suggestions for the adoption of integrated technologies are made.","Moyixi Lei, Longqin Xu, Tonglai Liu, Shuangyin Liu, Chuanheng Sun",10.3390/foods11152262,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11152262,Foods,51,2022,no,"The paper is focused on food traceability technology rather than academic literature analysis, and does not specifically address academic literature management or analysis.",no,There is no mention of citation analysis or bibliometric methods in the paper.

A systematic review of deep learning-based object detection methods for crop grading,"Crop grading represents a critical component in enhancing agricultural production efficiency and optimizing supply chain management. Through systematic assessment of crop appearance, quality attributes, and dimensional characteristics, accurate determination of market compliance and evaluation of quality grades and commercial value can be achieved. This systematic review comprehensively analyzes 53 studies published between 2020 and 2025 that employed deep learning-based target detection methods for automated crop grading applications. We establish a taxonomic framework categorizing detection methodologies into three distinct paradigms: two-stage detectors (characterized by high precision but substantial computational overhead), single-stage detectors (offering optimal speed-accuracy trade-offs), and emerging Transformer-based approaches (demonstrating superior global modeling capabilities). Our analysis reveals significant algorithmic evolution trends, with the YOLO series exhibiting dominant application across more than 30 crop varieties, achieving high detection accuracy while maintaining real-time performance capabilities. We systematically identify key technical challenges: sparse feature extraction under complex agricultural environments, severe class imbalance in defect detection tasks, and deployment constraints in edge computing scenarios. We propose a comprehensive solution framework that integrates multimodal data fusion (RGB-D-NIR), lightweight architectural optimization strategies, and semi-supervised learning approaches capable of reducing annotation requirements by 60–80%. Performance benchmarking on public datasets demonstrates that target detection methods exhibit superior engineering applicability compared to segmentation approaches, with enhanced inference speed and improved robustness to environmental variations. For future research directions, we categorize priorities into four domains: intelligent annotation systems, environmental adaptability enhancement, model compression techniques, and cross-domain transfer learning. This review provides a comprehensive technical framework for deep learning-driven crop grading, offering actionable insights for researchers and practical deployment guidelines for precision agriculture applications. We anticipate this review will inspire broader adoption of deep learning target detection methodologies in agricultural domains, fostering technological advancement and innovation in this field.","Xiangjian Zhu, Ling Ren, Miao Yang, Yuquan Zhang, Conghua Zhang, Jianpu Cui, Junping Liu",10.1079/ab.2025.0060,https://doi.org/10.1079/ab.2025.0060,CABI Agriculture and Bioscience,0,2025,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis, but rather on crop grading using deep learning, which is an entirely different domain.",no,"The paper does not involve citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF BIG DATA INTEGRATION CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS FOR HETEROGENEOUS DATA SOURCES,"This systematic review explores the current challenges and emerging solutions in big data integration, focusing on key issues such as semantic heterogeneity, data quality, scalability, and security. Using the PRISMA guidelines, 150 peer-reviewed articles were analyzed to identify both established and innovative approaches to integrating data from heterogeneous sources. The findings reveal that ontology-based frameworks are widely used to address semantic inconsistencies but face limitations in scalability when handling large, dynamic datasets. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for automating data quality and schema matching processes, although its effectiveness is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality training data. Distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark have become the industry standard for scalable data integration, yet their implementation requires significant infrastructure and technical expertise. Cloud-based platforms offer flexible, scalable solutions, but concerns about data privacy and security persist.

Lane Detection in Autonomous Vehicles: A Systematic Review,"One of the essential systems in autonomous vehicles for ensuring a secure circumstance for drivers and passengers is the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Adaptive Cruise Control, Automatic Braking/Steer Away, Lane-Keeping System, Blind Spot Assist, Lane Departure Warning System, and Lane Detection are examples of ADAS. Lane detection displays information specific to the geometrical features of lane line structures to the vehicle’s intelligent system to show the position of lane markings. This article reviews the methods employed for lane detection in an autonomous vehicle. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been carried out to analyze the most delicate approach to detecting the road lane for the benefit of the automation industry. One hundred and two publications from well-known databases were chosen for this review. The trend was discovered after thoroughly examining the selected articles on the method implemented for detecting the road lane from 2018 until 2021. The selected literature used various methods, with the input dataset being one of two types: self-collected or acquired from an online public dataset. In the meantime, the methodologies include geometric modeling and traditional methods, while AI includes deep learning and machine learning. The use of deep learning has been increasingly researched throughout the last four years. Some studies used stand-alone deep learning implementations for lane detection problems. Meanwhile, some research focuses on merging deep learning with other machine learning techniques and classical methodologies. Recent advancements imply that attention mechanism has become a popular combined strategy with deep learning methods. The use of deep algorithms in conjunction with other techniques showed promising outcomes. This research aims to provide a complete overview of the literature on lane detection methods, highlighting which approaches are currently being researched and the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques. Also, the paper covered the equipment used to collect the dataset for the training process and the dataset used for network training, validation, and testing. This review yields a valuable foundation on lane detection techniques, challenges, and opportunities and supports new research works in this automation field. For further study, it is suggested to put more effort into accuracy improvement, increased speed performance, and more challenging work on various extreme conditions in detecting the road lane.","N.

A Systematic Review of Citation Recommendation Over the Past Two Decades,"A citation is a reference to the source of information used in an article. Citations are very useful for students and researchers to locate relevant information on a topic. Proper citation is also important in the academic ethics of article writing. Due to the rapid growth of scientific works published each year, how to automatically recommend citations to students and researchers has become an interesting but challenging research problem. In particular, a citation recommendation system can assist students to identify relevant papers and literature for academic writing. Citation recommendation can be classified into local and global citation recommendation depending on whether a specific local citation context is given; e.g., the text surrounding a citation placeholder. This article provides a systematic review on global citation recommendation models and compares the reviewed methods from the traditional topic- based models to the recent models embedded with deep neural networks, aiming to summarize this field to facilitate researchers working on citation recommendation.","Yicong Liang, Lap-Kei Lee",10.4018/ijswis.324071,https://doi.org/10.4018/ijswis.324071,International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS),2,2023,yes,"The paper is clearly focused on academic literature, specifically dealing with citation recommendation for academic writing and research papers.",yes,"The paper directly addresses citation analysis and recommendation, which is a core bibliometric method.",yes,"The paper discusses advanced recommendation models, including deep neural networks, going well beyond basic database management.",maybe,"The abstract doesn't explicitly mention knowledge graphs or semantic analysis, though topic-based models might involve some semantic analysis.",yes,"The paper explicitly mentions deep neural networks and discusses various models for citation recommendation, indicating clear ML/NLP applications.",yes,"Citation recommendation is essentially a form of paper discovery algorithm, and the paper focuses on this specifically.",yes,"This appears to be a systematic review comparing different technical approaches, including traditional and neural network-based models, suggesting substantial technical content.",yes,The paper focuses on comparing different technical architectures for citation recommendation systems.,Include,"A systematic review of citation recommendation models demonstrates strong alignment with technical literature analysis criteria, particularly in machine learning, bibliometric methods, and intelligent paper discovery algorithms.

"Generative AI-Empowered Vehicle-Grid Interaction Large Models: Classification, Research Review and Application Dilemmas","With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deepening demand for smart grid construction, vehicle-grid interaction (VGI) has become a key link to optimize energy allocation and ensure grid stability. However, traditional VGI models face challenges in processing multi-modal, time-series VGI data and adapting to diverse application scenarios. This paper focuses on the construction and application of generative AI-enabled VGI large models, adopting a systematic review method. It classifies these models along the dimensions of technical architecture (e.g., Transformer variants, multi-modal fusion frameworks) and application scenarios (e.g., peak shaving and valley filling, virtual power plant collaboration), and systematically reviews research progress in both categories. Key research points include the core characteristics and application boundaries of different types of generative AI-based VGI large models, as well as the technical bottlenecks and practical obstacles in their current development. This paper concludes that Transformer-based models excel in time-series VGI data modeling, while multi-modal fusion models enhance interaction accuracy; in application scenarios, models show significant value in load regulation and resource aggregation but face challenges such as data privacy and computational efficiency.",Jiayi Gao,10.54254/2755-2721/2025.gl28734,https://doi.org/10.54254/2755-2721/2025.gl28734,Applied and Computational Engineering,0,2025,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature, but rather on the domain of electric vehicles and smart grids.

Automatic Image Annotation Based on Deep Learning Models: A Systematic Review and Future Challenges,"Recently, much attention has been given to image annotation due to the massive increase in image data volume. One of the image retrieval methods which guarantees the retrieval of images in the same way as texts are automatic image annotation (AIA). Consequently, numerous studies have been conducted on AIA, particularly on the classification-based and probabilistic modeling techniques. Several image annotation techniques that performed reasonably on standard datasets have been developed over the last decade. In this paper, a review of the image annotation method was conducted, focusing more on deep learning models. Automatic image annotation (AIA) methods were also classified into five categories, including i) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on AIA, ii) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on AIA, iii) Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based on AIA, iv) Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based on AIA, and v) Stacked auto-encoder (SAE) based on AIA. An assessment of the five varieties of AIA methods was also offered based on their principal notion, feature mining technique, explanation precision, computational density, and examined aggregated data. Moreover, the evaluation metrics used to evaluate AIA methods were reviewed and discussed. The need for careful consideration of methods throughout the improvement of novel procedures and datasets for image annotation assignment was highly demanded. From the analysis of the achievements so far, it is certain that more attention should be paid to automatic image annotation.","M. M. Adnan, M. Rahim, A. Rehman, Zahid Mehmood, T. Saba, R. A.

The State of the Art in Methodologies of Course Recommender Systems - A Review of Recent Research,"In recent years, education institutions have offered a wide range of course selections with overlaps. This presents significant challenges to students in selecting successful courses that match their current knowledge and personal goals. Although many studies have been conducted on Recommender Systems (RS), a review of methodologies used in course RS is still insufficiently explored. To fill this literature gap, this paper presents the state of the art of methodologies used in course RS along with the summary of the types of data sources used to evaluate these techniques. This review aims to recognize emerging trends in course RS techniques in recent research literature to deliver insights for researchers for further investigation. We provide a systematic review process followed by research findings on the current methodologies implemented in different course RS in selected research journals such as: collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based, Data Mining (DM), hybrid, statistical and Conversational RS (CRS). This study analyzed publications between 2016 and June 2020, in three repositories; IEEE Xplore, ACM, and Google Scholar. These papers were explored and classified based on the methodology used in recommending courses. This review has revealed that there is a growing popularity in hybrid course RS and followed by DM techniques in recent publications. However, few CRS-based course RS were present in the selected publications. Finally, we discussed future avenues based on the research outcome, which might lead to next-generation course RS.","D.

"Systematic Review of Fake News, Propaganda, and Disinformation: Examining Authors, Content, and Social Impact Through Machine Learning","In recent years, the world has witnessed a global outbreak of fake news, propaganda and disinformation (FNPD) flows on online social networks (OSN). In the context of information warfare and the capabilities of generative AI, FNPDs have proliferated. They have become a powerful and quite effective tool for influencing people’s social identities, attitudes, opinions and even behavior. Ad hoc malicious social media accounts and organized networks of trolls and bots target countries, societies, social groups, political campaigns and individuals. As a result, conspiracy theories, echo chambers, filter bubbles and other processes of fragmentation and marginalization are polarizing, radicalizing, and disintegrating society in terms of coherent politics, governance, and social networks of trust and cooperation. This systematic review aims to explore advances in using machine and deep learning to detect FNPD in OSNs effectively. We present the results of a combined PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review in three analysis domains: 1) propagators (authors, trolls, and bots), 2) textual content, 3) social impact. This systemic research framework integrates meta-analyses of three research domains, providing an overview of the wider research field and revealing important relationships between these research domains.

State-of-the-art technologies in precision agriculture: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND
The socio-economic status of the countries is ever-changing due to the increasing population. 'Green Revolution', a paradigm shift towards technology driven agriculture, has ensured a good quality of life to some extent for this increasing population. However, it brings in several negative impacts on the environment, which poses a threat to the sustainability of agriculture and natural resources. Precision agriculture (PA) is a state-of-the-art concept of site-specific farm management that helps to overcome this threat in a smart way using modern information and communication technologies. It reduces the indecorous use of resources, pollution and hence improves quality of life, which in turn helps to achieve sustainable development goals.
RESULTS
The objective of this systematic review is to understand the present status, benefits, and limitations of the state-of-the-art technologies used in PA. A total 67 articles are identified following the PRISMA guideline to inspect the technical innovations at different components of PA. The articles are examined based on the novelties, measured parameters, technologies, and field of applications.

From Extraction to Reasoning: A Systematic Review of Algorithms in Multi-Document Summarization and QA,"Multi-document summarization and question-answering (QA) have become pivotal tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), facilitating information extraction and decision-making across various domains. This systematic review explores the evolution of algorithms used in these tasks, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of traditional, modern, and emerging approaches. We examine the progression from early extractive methods, such as TFIDF and TextRank, to the advent of neural models like BERT, GPT, and T5 and the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for QA. Hybrid models combining traditional techniques with neural approaches and graph-based methods are also discussed. Through a detailed analysis of algorithmic frameworks, we identify key strengths, weaknesses, and challenges in current methodologies. Additionally, the review highlights recent trends such as unified models, multimodal algorithms, and the application of reinforcement learning in summarization and QA tasks. We also explore the real-world relevance of these algorithms in sectors such as news, legal, medical, and education.

Digital and intelligent standards for building and construction engineering: Current status and future,": To promote the development of digitalization and intelligence of construction engineering standards, achieving the machine readability and computability of standard specifications, this paper has conducted research on the current state of standard digitalization, proposed a grading model for the development stages of construction engineering standard digitalization and its typical application scenarios, providing a clear development path for the process of standard digitalization. Meanwhile, a key technical framework for the digitalization of construction engineering standards covering the intelligent interpretation of existing standards, intelligent compilation of incremental standards, and multi-scenario application of standards has been established. A systematic review of the research and application status, future needs, and key challenges of the key technologies in each part of the framework has also been conducted. Currently, significant progress has been made in knowledge extraction, rule interpretation, collaborative design, intelligent review, and other areas, providing strong support for the digitalization of standards.

"Semantic Communications for 6g Networks: Theory, Architectures, and Challenges","As 6G communication systems advance toward the grand vision of intelligent connectivity, the conventional bit-centric communication paradigm is encountering multiple bottlenecks in energy efficiency, spectrum utilization, and security when addressing the extreme demands of millisecond-level latency, terabit-per-second data rates, and massive connectivity. Semantic communication, as a paradigm shift from transmitting bits to conveying meaning, offers a critical pathway to overcoming these limitations. This survey provides a systematic review and forward-looking analysis of semantic communication technologies for 6G. We clarify the core value of semantic communication—namely, achieving a qualitative leap in communication efficiency and network intelligence by intelligently extracting and transmitting task-relevant semantic information. Furthermore, we examine three key technological evolution paths: interpretable approaches grounded in traditional model-based optimization; dedicated, efficient schemes driven by deep learning; and cognitive communication paradigms empowered by large-scale foundation models. For each path, we present a critical analysis of its strengths, limitations, and ongoing debates. We then summarize four representative 6G architectures enabled by semantic communication, elucidating their design goals, technical distinctions, and inherent trade-offs. Finally, we identify the open research challenges and outline promising future research directions.

A systematic review of long document summarization methods: Evaluation metrics and approaches,"The rapid growth of complex textual data in domains such as medicine, law, and science has heightened the relevance of Long Document Summarization (LDS). Effective summarization not only requires advanced techniques but also robust evaluation metrics capable of capturing summary quality, coherence, and factual accuracy. We analyze 113 peer-reviewed studies from last two years, selected through comprehensive searches in SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PubMed, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We focus on LDS methods and the metrics used to evaluate them. Results indicate a rising adoption of hybrid models combining extractive and abstractive strategies, frequently powered by deep learning and optimization. Concurrently, evaluation practices have shifted from traditional overlap-based metrics (e.g., ROUGE) toward semantic measures such as BERTScore and MoverScore. However, these metrics still face challenges related to interpretability, domain adaptation, and computational cost. We advocate for the development of holistic, explainable, and reference-free evaluation frameworks aligned with human judgment to enhance the reliability and applicability of LDS systems across domains.","Bady Gana, Héctor Allende-Cid, Stefan Rüping, Marcelo Becerra-Rozas, Juan Zamora",10.1016/j.neucom.2025.131287,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2025.131287,Neurocomputing,0,2025,yes,"The paper explicitly focuses on academic literature, analyzing 113 peer-reviewed studies from academic databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PubMed).",maybe,"While the paper analyzes academic literature, it doesn't specifically focus on citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

"Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning: Advancements, challenges, and future directions","In recent years, affective computing has become a topic of considerable interest, driven by its ability to enhance several domains, such as mental health monitoring, human–computer interaction, and personalized advertising. The progress of affective computing has been extensively supported by the emergence of sub-domains such as sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have made significant advancements in the realm of emotion recognition, resulting in the emergence of Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) systems that are capable of effectively processing data from various sources, such as audio, video, and text. However, despite the considerable progress made, there are still several challenges that persist in MER systems. Moreover, existing surveys often lack a specific focus on MER and the associated DL architectures. To address these research gaps, this study provides an in-depth systematic review of DL-based MER systems. This review encompasses the recent state-of-the-art models, foundational theories, DL architectures, mechanisms for fusing multimodal information, relevant datasets, performance evaluation, and practical applications. Additionally, the study identifies key challenges and limitations in MER systems and suggests future research opportunities.

Applications of deep learning in precision weed management: A review,"Deep Learning (DL) has been described as one of the key subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is transforming weed detection for site-specific weed management (SSWM). In the last demi-decade, DL techniques have been integrated with ground as well as aerial-based technologies to identify weeds in still image context and real-time setting. After observing the current research trend in DL-based weed detection, techniques are advancing by assisting precision weeding technologies to make smart decisions. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to present a systematic review study that involves DL-based weed detection techniques and technologies available for SSWM. To accomplish this study, a comprehensive literature survey was performed that consists of 60 closest technical papers on DL-based weed detection. The key findings are summarized as follows, a) transfer learning approach is a widely adopted technique to address weed detection in majority of research work, b) less focus navigated towards custom designed neural networks for weed detection task, c) based on the pretrained models deployed on test dataset, no one specific model can be attributed to have achieved high accuracy on multiple field images pertaining to several research studies, d) inferencing DL models on resource-constrained edge devices with limited number of dataset is lagging, e) different versions of YOLO (mostly v3) is a widely adopted model for detecting weeds in real-time scenario, f) SegNet and U-Net models have been deployed to accomplish semantic segmentation task in multispectral aerial imagery, g) less number of open-source weed image dataset acquired using drones, h) lack of research in exploring optimization and generalization techniques for weed identification in aerial images, i) research in exploring ways to design models that consume less training hours, low-power consumption and less parameters during training or inferencing, and j) slow-moving advances in optimizing models based on domain adaptation approach.

Machine Learning Techniques and Privacy Concerns in Human-Computer Interactions: A Systematic Review,"With the recent development of artificial intelligence, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has received an increasing amount of attention. Among all topics under HCI, machine learning and privacy concerns are two of the most important ones. One of the machine learning techniques that possess a strong connection with privacy is federated learning, which distributes learning tasks to individual devices to reduce information sharing and protect privacy. In this study, a systematic literature review of our topic has been conducted using various tools including Harzing’s Publish or Perish, Google nGram, Vicinitas, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, BibExcel, and maxQDA. The software Mendeley is also used to help sort out citation items. Trend analysis, co-citation analysis, content analysis, and cluster analysis have been conducted to identify the most important articles in the literature. It has been found that the two topics have been well studied and together they have a variety of applications, including communication networks, the healthcare industry, and the Internet of Things. Finally, we discuss the potential future work beyond our topics which cover directions in application fields such as healthcare and finance, and other machine learning techniques developed based on federated learning.","Jun He, Tianyu Cao, Vincent G.

Deep learning in cultural imagery dissemination: a systematic scoping review of AI-driven visual transmission mechanisms,"In an era of rapid media technology and AI advancement, deep learning (DL)-driven visual images (VI) is emerging as a critical mode of cultural transmission (CT). Despite the growing application of DL in the VI domain, there is a lack of a systematic review that comprehensively explores its transmission pathways, mechanisms of influence, and associated challenges. This study aims to systematically explore the pathways and impacts of DL-driven VI in CT and identify key trends and issues in the field through a systematic scoping review of existing literature.This review analyzes 18 studies published between 2015 and 2024. The literature search was conducted across five databases: WOS, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ACM, and A&HCI. The research was undertaken rigorously following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, ensuring systematic selection, extraction, and analysis of the identified studies.The study analyzed the literature from four aspects: transmission pathways, content, technology, and cultural context, identifying three main research areas: (1) the influence mechanisms of AI and social media on cultural transmission; (2) the role of VI in cross-cultural communication; and (3) the application of AI and digital technology in the conservation of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). The study finds that AI-driven visual technologies significantly enhance the breadth and impact of CT, particularly through DL algorithms. However, the field faces critical challenges such as algorithmic bias, cultural homogenization, and the reliability of user-generated content.By systematically synthesizing the existing literature, this study provides a theoretical foundation for future research and points to emerging research directions, such as how to use DL to address ethical challenges in cultural communication and explore the differences in the application of DL and VI in different cultural contexts.","Jinhua Yang, Ting Liu, Y.

A Systematic Review of Automated Query Reformulations in Source Code Search,"Fixing software bugs and adding new features are two of the major maintenance tasks. Software bugs and features are reported as change requests. Developers consult these requests and often choose a few keywords from them as an ad hoc query. Then they execute the query with a search engine to find the exact locations within software code that need to be changed. Unfortunately, even experienced developers often fail to choose appropriate queries, which leads to costly trials and errors during a code search. Over the years, many studies have attempted to reformulate the ad hoc queries from developers to support them. In this systematic literature review, we carefully select 70 primary studies on query reformulations from 2,970 candidate studies, perform an in-depth qualitative analysis (e.g., Grounded Theory), and then answer seven research questions with major findings. First, to date, eight major methodologies (e.g., term weighting, term co-occurrence analysis, thesaurus lookup) have been adopted to reformulate queries. Second, the existing studies suffer from several major limitations (e.g., lack of generalizability, the vocabulary mismatch problem, subjective bias) that might prevent their wide adoption. Finally, we discuss the best practices and future opportunities to advance the state of research in search query reformulations.","M. M. Rahman, C.

There are many approaches to build recommender systems, and two of the most prominent advances in area have been the use of Embeddings to represent the data in the recommender system, and the use of Deep Learning architectures to generate the recommendations to the user. A systematic review adopts a formal and systematic method to perform a bibliographic review, and it is used to identify and evaluate all the research in certain area of study, by analyzing the relevant research published. A systematic review was conducted to understand how the Deep Learning and Embeddings techniques are being applied to improve Context-Aware Recommender Systems.

"Multimodal sentiment analysis: A systematic review of history, datasets, multimodal fusion methods, applications, challenges and future directions","Sentiment analysis (SA) has gained much traction In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). There is growing demand to automate analysis of user sentiment towards products or services. Opinions are increasingly being shared online in the form of videos rather than text alone. This has led to SA using multiple modalities, termed Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), becoming an important research area. MSA utilises latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning at various stages including for multimodal feature extraction and fusion and sentiment polarity detection, with aims to minimize error rate and improve performance. This survey paper examines primary taxonomy and newly released multimodal fusion architectures. Recent developments in MSA architectures are divided into ten categories, namely early fusion, late fusion, hybrid fusion, model-level fusion, tensor fusion, hierarchical fusion, bi-modal fusion, attention-based fusion, quantum-based fusion and word-level fusion.

The Current Development Status of Agricultural Machinery Chassis in Hilly and Mountainous Regions,"The scenario adaptability of agricultural machinery chassis in hilly and mountainous regions has become a key area of innovation in modern agricultural equipment development in China. Due to the fragmented nature of farmland, steep terrain (often exceeding 15°), complex topography, and limited suitability for mechanization, traditional agricultural machinery experiences significantly reduced operational efficiency—typically by 30% to 50%—along with poor mobility. These limitations impose serious constraints on grain yield stability and the advancement of agricultural modernization. Therefore, enhancing the scenario-adaptive performance of chassis systems (e.g., slope adaptability ≥ 25°, lateral tilt stability > 30°) is a major research priority for China’s agricultural equipment industry. This paper presents a systematic review of the global development status of agricultural machinery chassis tailored for hilly and mountainous environments. It focuses on three core subsystems—power systems, traveling systems, and leveling systems—and analyzes their technical characteristics, working principles, and scenario-specific adaptability. In alignment with China’s “Dual Carbon” strategy and the unique operational requirements of hilly–mountainous areas (such as high gradients, uneven terrain, and small field sizes), this study proposes three key technological directions for the development of intelligent agricultural machinery chassis: (1) Multi-mode traveling mechanism design: Aimed at improving terrain traversability (ground clearance ≥400 mm, obstacle-crossing height ≥ 250 mm) and traction stability (slip ratio < 15%) across diverse landscapes. (2) Coordinated control algorithm optimization: Designed to ensure stable torque output (fluctuation rate < ±10%) and maintain gradient operation efficiency (e.g., less than 15% efficiency loss on 25° slopes) through power–drive synergy while also optimizing energy management strategies. (3) Intelligent perception system integration: Facilitating high-precision adaptive leveling (accuracy ± 0.5°, response time < 3 s) and enabling terrain-adaptive mechanism optimization to enhance platform stability and operational safety. By establishing these performance benchmarks and focusing on critical technical priorities—including terrain-adaptive mechanism upgrades, energy-drive coordination, and precision leveling—this study provides a clear roadmap for the development of modular and intelligent chassis systems specifically designed for China’s hilly and mountainous regions, thereby addressing current bottlenecks in agricultural mechanization.","Renkai Ding, Xiangyuan Qi, Xuwen Chen, Yixin Mei, Anze Li",10.3390/app15137505,https://doi.org/10.3390/app15137505,Applied Sciences,4,2025,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis at all.

Exploring Agriculture 4.0: A Systematic Review of Digital Innovations in the Agricultural Sector,"Global food security remains fundamentally dependent on agricultural systems. Escalating demographic pressures have intensified demands on food production networks, compelling a shift from traditional agrarian practices toward technologically sophisticated methodologies under the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. Optimizing the benefits of this transformation requires resolving implementation constraints across technological and socio-economic dimensions. This empirical investigation advances the Agriculture 4.0 discourse through systematic analysis of emergent digital farming innovations. Employing PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standardized protocols, we conducted a decade-long assessment of peer-reviewed crop production research. From 148 methodologically selected publications, we evaluated technology adoption patterns across three analytical vectors: service typology, implementation maturity, and production system classification. Key findings demonstrate concentrated scholarly focus on autonomous robotics, IoT architectures, and machine learning implementations. Production environment analysis revealed disproportionate research attention: open-field systems represented 69% of examined cases, while controlled-environment agriculture constituted 31%.

A Review of Deep Learning in Rotating Machinery Fault Diagnosis and Its Prospects for Port Applications,"As port operations rapidly evolve toward intelligent and heavy-duty applications, fault diagnosis for core equipment demands higher levels of real-time performance and robustness. Deep learning, with its powerful autonomous feature learning capabilities, demonstrates significant potential in mechanical fault prediction and health management. This paper first provides a systematic review of deep learning research advances in rotating machinery fault diagnosis over the past eight years, focusing on the technical approaches and application cases of four representative models: Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Auto-encoders (AEs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These models, respectively, embody four core paradigms, unsupervised feature generation, spatial pattern extraction, data reconstruction learning, and temporal dependency modeling, forming the technological foundation of contemporary intelligent diagnostics. Building upon this foundation, this paper delves into the unique challenges encountered when transferring these methods from generic laboratory components to specialized port equipment such as shore cranes and yard cranes—including complex operating conditions, harsh environments, and system coupling.

When 5G Meets Deep Learning: A Systematic Review,"This last decade, the amount of data exchanged on the Internet increased by over a staggering factor of 100, and is expected to exceed well over the 500 exabytes by 2020. This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration.","Guto Leoni Santos, P. Endo, D. Sadok, J.

Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Into Academic Literature Reviews: An overview,"Introduction: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in academic research has transformed the methodology of literature reviews, providing increased efficiency, wider scope, and superior analytical skills. This change poses concerns around ethical use, methodological openness, and the significance of human judgement in AI-assisted procedures.
Materials and Methods: This research used a PRISMA-compliant systematic review technique to investigate the ethical and effective application of AI in literature reviews. A thorough search was performed across databases including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar using keywords such as “AI and academic writing,” “AI in literature reviews,” and “machine-assisted literature review.” The analysis included peer-reviewed studies produced from 2020 to 2024, eliminating non-empirical publications and those irrelevant to AI in academic literature review procedures.
Results: The preliminary search yielded 1,153 publications. Following the elimination of duplicates and a multi-tiered screening process, 229 studies were chosen for final evaluation. The results emphasised critical topics like the need of openness, human supervision, source validation, ethical tool selection, and training for responsible AI use. Identified challenges including algorithmic bias, insufficient contextual comprehension, and concerns around repeatability and data privacy.
Discussion: The research indicates that while AI may greatly enhance the efficiency of literature review processes, it requires vigilant human supervision to protect academic integrity. Ethical concerns, such as intellectual property rights and data security, need comprehensive institutional policies and user understanding. Moreover, the need for explicit documentation and replication highlights the significance of integrating AI skills with human intellectual discernment.
Conclusion: Artificial intelligence is a potent instrument for augmenting academic literature evaluations; yet, it cannot replace human competence. Researchers must prioritise openness, ethical norms, and ongoing training to guarantee responsible use. A hybrid methodology that combines AI efficiency with human critical assessment presents the most sustainable and academically robust trajectory moving ahead.","Edmond Osei Arhin, Festus Cobena Ainoo, Kwame Amponsah",10.53346/wjast.2025.7.1.0010,https://doi.org/10.53346/wjast.2025.7.1.0010,World Journal of Advanced Science and Technology,0,2025,yes,The paper is explicitly focused on academic literature review processes and AI applications within academic research contexts.,maybe,"While the paper discusses literature review methodology, it doesn't explicitly mention citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

SoK: AI-Powered Security Analysis of Smart Contract,"With the soaring popularity of decentralized applications (DApps), smart contract security has become increasingly important. Recently, numerous studies have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance efficiency and functional diversity of smart contract security analysis. However, a comprehensive survey of these studies to guide future development is still missing. To fill this gap, we present an innovative and systematic review. First, we establish filtering criteria and define Literature Attributes (LA) to identify 27 representative papers in this field. We then trace their evolution from 2018 and summarize four key research problems. Next, we compare three AI-powered smart contract security analysis tools—DLVA, xFuzz, and GURU—against traditional methods, demonstrating that AI tools still have room for improvement in precision.

A semantic similarity analysis of Internet of Things,"ABSTRACT Internet of Things (IoT) has gradually become one of the most popular topics among both academia and industry, and it is considered as a crucial part of future Internet. However, very few objective and systematic review was conducted to address high-value articles and summarize the intellectual components from journals for examination and identification of the intellectual core and structure of IoT. Therefore, this study conducted a co-citation analysis for IoT by using 68 high-value articles retrieved within 1457 source papers from Web of Science online database. By using factor analysis, ten critical factors were identified, which includes (1) frameworks and challenges of IoT; (2) current situation of IoT in different applications; (3) interactions of IoT; (4) security issues of IoT; (5) application domains of IoT; (6) data management of IoT; (7) IoT in product lifecycle management; (8) enabling technologies of IoT; (9) IoT in smart cities; (10) IoT in recommender systems.

"A Systematic Review of Lean Construction, BIM and Emerging Technologies Integration: Identifying Key Tools","The construction industry, a cornerstone of global economic growth, continues to struggle with entrenched inefficiencies, including low productivity, cost overruns, and fragmented project delivery. Addressing these persistent challenges requires more than incremental improvements, it demands a strategic unification of Lean Construction, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Emerging Technologies. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from 64 academic studies to identify the most influential tools, techniques, and methodologies across these domains, revealing both their individual strengths and untapped synergies. The analysis highlights widely adopted Lean practices such as the Last Planner System (LPS) and Just-In-Time (JIT); BIM capabilities across 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, and 7D dimensions; and a spectrum of digital innovations including Digital Twins, AR/VR/MR, AI, IoT, robotics, and blockchain. Crucially, the review demonstrates that despite rapid advancements, integration remains sporadic and unstructured, representing a critical research and industry gap. By moving beyond descriptive mapping, this study establishes an essential foundation for the development of robust, adaptable integration frameworks capable of bridging theory and practice. Such frameworks are urgently needed to optimize efficiency, enhance sustainability, and enable innovation in large-scale and complex construction projects, positioning this work as both a scholarly contribution and a practical roadmap for future research and implementation.","Omar Alnajjar, E.

AutoML: A Systematic Review on Automated Machine Learning with Neural Architecture Search,"AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) is an emerging field that aims to automate the process of building machine learning models. AutoML emerged to increase productivity and efficiency by automating as much as possible the inefficient work that occurs while repeating this process whenever machine learning is applied. In particular, research has been conducted for a long time on technologies that can effectively develop high-quality models by minimizing the intervention of model developers in the process from data preprocessing to algorithm selection and tuning. In this semantic review research, we summarize the data processing requirements for AutoML approaches and provide a detailed explanation. We place greater emphasis on neural architecture search (NAS) as it currently represents a highly popular sub-topic within the field of AutoML. NAS methods use machine learning algorithms to search through a large space of possible architectures and find the one that performs best on a given task. We provide a summary of the performance achieved by representative NAS algorithms on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and well-known benchmark datasets. Additionally, we delve into several noteworthy research directions in NAS methods including one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS and joint hyperparameter with architecture optimization. We discussed how the search space size and complexity in NAS can vary depending on the specific problem being addressed. To conclude, we examine several open problems (SOTA problems) within current AutoML methods that assure further investigation in future research.","Imrus Salehin, Md.Shamiul Islam, Pritom Saha, S. M.

Digitalization and the Innovation of Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review,"Abstract The implementation of new technologies comes with the use of digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as core drivers. AI, including machine learning and deep learning, thrives in digitally mature environments with robust infrastructures and vast data availability With respect to AI innovations, digitalization is equally important because it provides the necessary computation power, data frameworks, and even the network systems needed to spearhead innovations. However, global disparities exist, with the United States and China excelling in AI commercialization, while Europe leads in academic research but struggles with industry adoption due to fragmented policies and inconsistent investment in AI-driven enterprises. This study conducts a systematic bibliometric analysis to examine the relationship between digitalization and AI research productivity. Using data from the Web of Science Core Collection, bibliometric techniques such as keyword co-occurrence analysis, citation network mapping, and thematic clustering were applied to assess AI research trends and their connection to digitalization. Responding to the outlining issue: How has digitalization influenced AI research evolution, and what are the key bibliometric trends? Findings confirm that digitally advanced regions lead in AI research output, while Europe faces commercialization challenges due to regulatory constraints and weak industry-academia collaboration. This study offers a novel contribution by integrating bibliometric analysis with policy insights to examine AI commercialization challenges, a dimension that has received limited attention in prior systematic reviews. This analysis points to insufficient academic activity and industrial adoption and calls for collaboration, dedicated policies for AI, and infrastructure investments. This helps policymakers focused on AI innovation as well as those in charge of AI governance and business leaders aiming to improve industry competition and commercialization.","Georgiana-Alina Crișan, A.

Unraveling the landscape of large language models: a systematic review and future perspectives,"PurposeThe rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has propelled them to the forefront of applications in natural language processing (NLP). This paper aims to present a comprehensive examination of the research landscape in LLMs, providing an overview of the prevailing themes and topics within this dynamic domain.Design/methodology/approachDrawing from an extensive corpus of 198 records published between 1996 to 2023 from the relevant academic database encompassing journal articles, books, book chapters, conference papers and selected working papers, this study delves deep into the multifaceted world of LLM research. In this study, the authors employed the BERTopic algorithm, a recent advancement in topic modeling, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data after it had been meticulously cleaned and preprocessed. BERTopic leverages the power of transformer-based language models like bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to generate more meaningful and coherent topics. This approach facilitates the identification of hidden patterns within the data, enabling authors to uncover valuable insights that might otherwise have remained obscure. The analysis revealed four distinct clusters of topics in LLM research: “language and NLP”, “education and teaching”, “clinical and medical applications” and “speech and recognition techniques”. Each cluster embodies a unique aspect of LLM application and showcases the breadth of possibilities that LLM technology has to offer. In addition to presenting the research findings, this paper identifies key challenges and opportunities in the realm of LLMs. It underscores the necessity for further investigation in specific areas, including the paramount importance of addressing potential biases, transparency and explainability, data privacy and security, and responsible deployment of LLM technology.FindingsThe analysis revealed four distinct clusters of topics in LLM research: “language and NLP”, “education and teaching”, “clinical and medical applications” and “speech and recognition techniques”.

ChatGPT-Like Large-Scale Foundation Models for Prognostics and Health Management: A Survey and Roadmaps,"Prognostics and health management (PHM) technology plays a critical role in industrial production and equipment maintenance by identifying and predicting possible equipment failures and damages, thereby allowing necessary maintenance measures to be taken to enhance equipment service life and reliability while reducing production costs and downtime. In recent years, PHM technology based on artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in the context of the industrial IoT and big data, and it is widely used in various industries, such as railway, energy, and aviation, for condition monitoring, fault prediction, and health management. The emergence of large-scale foundation models (LSF-Models) such as ChatGPT and DALLE-E marks the entry of AI into a new era of AI-2.0 from AI-1.0, where deep models have rapidly evolved from a research paradigm of single-modal, single-task, and limited-data to a multi-modal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model paradigm. ChatGPT represents a landmark achievement in this research paradigm, offering hope for general artificial intelligence due to its highly intelligent natural language understanding ability. However, the PHM field lacks a consensus on how to respond to this significant change in the AI field, and a systematic review and roadmap is required to elucidate future development directions. To fill this gap, this paper systematically expounds on the key components and latest developments of LSF-Models. Then, we systematically answered how to build the LSF-Model applicable to PHM tasks and outlined the challenges and future development roadmaps for this research paradigm.","Yanfang Li, Huan Wang, Muxia Sun",10.48550/arXiv.2305.06472,https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.06472,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,83,2023,no,"The paper does not focus on academic literature analysis.

Personality and safety behavior: An analysis of worldwide research on road and traffic safety leading to organizational and policy implications,"This study presents a comprehensive systematic review of worldwide research on the relationship between personality and safety behaviors in context of road and traffic safety to identify key areas, current global trends, and suggest future research direction towards understanding nuances of personality as predictor of accident involvement and risk-taking behaviors. Using bibliometric and visual analysis methods, we examine a sample of 613 studies extracted from the Scopus database based on a search query string with rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria. Keyword co-occurrence analysis shows five clusters representing focal areas studied by scholars in the field globally which are then classified into central, niche, and emergent themes using the strategic diagram. Further, using citation analysis, co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling, we highlight the intellectual structure of the knowledge domain and identify potential future areas for research. The results indicate that the research field is yet to be fully developed and more research is warranted towards wider personality traits and subtypes, using different structures of personality, employing longitudinal designs and behavioral methods, and expending insights from personality research for accident prevention and to develop and predict directives for self-driving vehicles.

Embodied intelligence for robot manipulation: development and challenges,"Abstract Embodied intelligence is regarded as a key pathway to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to its ability to enable direct interaction between digital information and the physical environment. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, embodied intelligence has demonstrated strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and generalization within real-world environments, driving the transformation of AI systems from data-driven to embodiment-based and reshaping the paradigm of robotic manipulation. Currently, research on embodied manipulation is advancing rapidly, and there is an urgent need for a systematic review focusing on embodied manipulation: to construct the core concepts of embodied manipulation, summarize previous literature, break through the limitations of unstructured organization, propose solutions to existing dilemmas, and provide systematic support for the practical implementation of intelligence. This paper focuses on the field of robot manipulation driven by embodied intelligence and conducts a systematic review: it analyzes the conceptual connotation of embodied manipulation and clarifies its definition as taking embodied cognition as the engine and physical robots as the carrier, sorts out its core characteristics and challenges, and reviews the supporting research outcomes in this field; the core part centers on the dual paradigms of data-driven and model-driven approaches, conducts an in-depth analysis of the diverse research status in the field of embodied manipulation, and clarifies the core value of data and models in this context; finally, it specifically analyzes the current research dilemmas and proposes future research directions based on solutions to these dilemmas.

Multi-source Multimodal Data and Deep Learning for Disaster Response: A Systematic Review,"Mechanisms for sharing information in a disaster situation have drastically changed due to new technological innovations throughout the world. The use of social media applications and collaborative technologies for information sharing have become increasingly popular. With these advancements, the amount of data collected increases daily in different modalities, such as text, audio, video, and images. However, to date, practical Disaster Response (DR) activities are mostly depended on textual information, such as situation reports and email content, and the benefit of other media is often not realised. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have recently demonstrated promising results in extracting knowledge from multiple modalities of data, but the use of DL approaches for DR tasks has thus far mostly been pursued in an academic context. This paper conducts a systematic review of 83 articles to identify the successes, current and future challenges, and opportunities in using DL for DR tasks. Our analysis is centred around the components of learning, a set of aspects that govern the application of Machine learning (ML) for a given problem domain. A flowchart and guidance for future research are developed as an outcome of the analysis to ensure the benefits of DL for DR activities are utilized.","N. Algiriyage, R.

"Abstractive Text Summarization: A Systematic Review of Techniques, Evaluation, and Future Directions","Digital text is growing at an exponential rate, which makes effective Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) more important than ever. This paper gives a full overview of abstractive text summarization, including how it has changed over time, how it is evaluated, the problems it still faces, and where future research should go. We look at the most important architectural paradigms, starting with the early Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models that were improved by attention and pointer-generator mechanisms. We then move on to the ""pre-train and fine-tune"" era, which was defined by Transformer-based models like BART, T5, and PEGASUS. The review ends with the current state-of-the-art, which is marked by the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) that use zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our research shows that there is a basic trade-off: modern models, especially LLMs, are the most fluent and coherent, but they often fail because they are not factually consistent, which leads to the problem of ""hallucination."" The field also has problems with strong evaluation that go beyond lexical overlap metrics like ROUGE, high computational costs, and limited adaptability to new domains. Researchers will work on solving these problems in the future by using methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), making evaluation metrics that are more aware of facts, and making models that are more efficient, controllable, and fair. In the end, the field is moving toward hybrid systems that combine the generative power of LLMs with the factual reliability of outside knowledge. The goal is to make summaries that are not only like humans but also useful in the real world.","Anu Saini, Jyoti Vashishtha, Sunita Beniwal",10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i05.54789,https://doi.org/10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i05.54789,International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research,0,2025,no,"The paper discusses text summarization broadly and does not specifically focus on academic literature.

Shaping Architecture with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Deep Learning Models in Architectural Design Workflow,"Deep-learning generative AI promises to transform architectural design, yet its potential employment and ready-to-use capacity for professional workflows are unclear. This study presents a systematic review conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, synthesizing peer-reviewed work from 2015 to 2025 to assess how GenAI methods align with architectural practice. A total of 1566 records were initially retrieved across databases, of which 42 studies met eligibility criteria after structured screening and selection. Each was evaluated using five indicators with a three-tier rubric: Output Representation Type, Pipeline Integration, Workflow Standardization, Tool Readiness, and Technical Skillset. Results show that most outputs are raster images or non-editable objects, with only a minority producing CAD/BIM-ready geometry. Workflow pipelines are often fragmented with manual hand-offs and most GenAI methods map only onto the early conceptual design stage. Prototypes frequently require bespoke coding and advanced expertise. These findings indicate a persistent gap between experimentation with ideation-oriented GenAI and the pragmatism of CAD/BIM-centered delivery. By framing the proposed rubric as a workflow maturity model, this review contributes a replicable benchmark for assessing practice readiness and identifying pathways toward mainstream adoption. For GenAI to move from prototypes to mainstream architectural design practice, it is essential to address not only technical barriers, but also cultural issues such as professional skepticism and reliability concerns, as well as ecosystem challenges of data sharing, authorship, and liability.",S.

The role of deep learning in urban water management: A critical review.,"Deep learning techniques and algorithms are emerging as a disruptive technology with the potential to transform global economies, environments and societies. They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed. Five research challenges, i.e., data privacy, algorithmic development, explainability and trustworthiness, multi-agent systems and digital twins, are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management. Future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy. We hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world.","G.

The Role of Transformer Models in Advancing Blockchain Technology: A Systematic Survey,"As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, the demand for enhanced efficiency, security, and scalability grows.Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures,have shown unprecedented potential in addressing various blockchain challenges. However, a systematic review of Transformer applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain,we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations,and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology.

Foliar Nitrogen Estimation with Artificial Intelligence and Technological Tools: State of the Art and Future Challenges,"—Nitrogen plays a fundamental role in plant growth, but its high application has significant negative impacts for the farmers and the environment. This nutrient is often provided in excess to prevent plant growth limitations when it ought to be administered in the exact quantities because many farmers do not have access to technology or affordable soil and plant chemical analyses. Precision agriculture through monitoring of crop nutrition may be possible with quantitative, non-destructive methods and technological tools that allow farmers to conduct a rapid and representative verification of their fertilizer applications. In this sense, we carried out a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of recent scientific research to answer the questions: 1) Can artificial intelligence-based, non-destructive analysis of plant nutrition provide relevant information for decision-making in agricultural systems?, 2) Have recent studies reached the stage of developing technological tools to be applied in agricultural systems and field conditions?, and 3) What is the way forward to achieve popularization of the application and development of technological tools in agricultural systems? We found that non-destructive analyses of foliar nutrition need to provide more supportive information for decision-making given the challenge of interpreting and replicating results in agricultural systems operating under uncontrolled conditions, such as field conditions. To address this issue, we propose developing accessible technological tools, such as mobile applications, tailored to farmers’ needs. However, most studies had not yet considered developing a technological tool as part of their objectives. Therefore, it is critical to develop accessible and affordable technologies and monitoring systems that approach precision agriculture since the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources demands translating scientific knowledge into supporting tools that reach farmers and decision-makers worldwide. The way forward is innovation through technological developments that enhance current agricultural systems.","Ángeles Gallegos, M.

The integration of modern information technologies, such as machine learning, cloud computing, and computer algebra systems (CAS), has revolutionized problem-solving in mathematics and computer science. These technologies enhance computational speed, accuracy, and efficiency, offering new methods for approaching complex problems in both research and educational contexts. This systematic review evaluates the role of these technologies in improving problem-solving processes and their implications for educational practices in mathematics and computer science.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A comprehensive search was conducted in academic databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, targeting peer-reviewed articles, books, and conference proceedings published from 2016 to 2025. The review focuses on studies involving machine learning, cloud computing, and CAS, particularly those addressing their educational applications in mathematics and programming instruction.

Spinopelvic measurements of sagittal balance with deep learning: systematic review and critical evaluation,"PURPOSE
To summarize and critically evaluate the existing studies for spinopelvic measurements of sagittal balance that are based on deep learning (DL).
METHODS
Three databases (PubMed, WoS and Scopus) were queried for records using keywords related to DL and measurement of sagittal balance. After screening the resulting 529 records that were augmented with specific web search, 34 studies published between 2017 and 2022 were included in the final review, and evaluated from the perspective of the observed sagittal spinopelvic parameters, properties of spine image datasets, applied DL methodology and resulting measurement performance.
RESULTS
Studies reported DL measurement of up to 18 different spinopelvic parameters, but the actual number depended on the image field of view. Image datasets were composed of lateral lumbar spine and whole spine X-rays, biplanar whole spine X-rays and lumbar spine magnetic resonance cross sections, and were increasing in size or enriched by augmentation techniques. Spinopelvic parameter measurement was approached either by landmark detection or structure segmentation, and U-Net was the most frequently applied DL architecture. The latest DL methods achieved excellent performance in terms of mean absolute error against reference manual measurements (~ 2° or ~ 1 mm).
CONCLUSION
Although the application of relatively complex DL architectures resulted in an improved measurement accuracy of sagittal spinopelvic parameters, future methods should focus on multi-institution and multi-observer analyses as well as uncertainty estimation and error handling implementations for integration into the clinical workflow. Further advances will enhance the predictive analytics of DL methods for spinopelvic parameter measurement.

Examining the Global Patent Landscape of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Solutions for COVID-19,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely applied to tackle Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) challenges, from diagnosis to prevention. Patents are a valuable source for understanding the AI technologies used in the COVID-19 context, allowing the identification of the current technological scenario, fields of application, and research, development, and innovation trends. This study aimed to analyze the global patent landscape of AI applications related to COVID-19. To do so, we analyzed AI-related COVID-19 patent metadata collected in the Derwent Innovations Index using systematic review, bibliometrics, and network analysis., Our results show diagnosis as the most frequent application field, followed by prevention. Deep Learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were predominantly used for diagnosis, while Machine Learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), were mainly used for prevention. The most frequent International Patent Classification Codes were related to computing arrangements based on specific computational models, information, and communication technology for detecting, monitoring, or modeling epidemics or pandemics, and methods or arrangements for pattern recognition using electronic means. The most central algorithms of the two-mode network were CNN, SVM, and Random Forest (RF), while the most central application fields were diagnosis, prevention, and forecast. The most significant connection between algorithms and application fields occurred between CNN and diagnosis.

Classification and Application of Deep Learning in Construction Engineering and Management – A Systematic Literature Review and Future Innovations,"In the ever-evolving landscape of construction engineering and management (CEM), the dynamic and unique characteristics of construction project environments constantly present multifaceted challenges. These challenges are characterized by the extensive volume of project-specific information and intricate engineering data. Deep learning (DL), with its advanced analytical capabilities, has been emerging as a robust solution to these complexities. While the application of DL in CEM is on an upward trajectory, a systematic review of its implementation is conspicuously lacking. This paper, therefore, embarks on a scientometric and qualitative analysis of 296 DL-based studies related to CEM from 2014 to 2024 in the renowned data science repositories Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science to explore the characteristics of journals, keywords and clusters. It is found that six research topics have fully utilized the advantages of DL in CEM in the last decade, including construction equipment management, structural health monitoring, construction site safety management, construction schedule management, worker health management and workforce assessment and intelligent design. Then, the studies under each research topic are summarized separately and a searchable taxonomy is proposed that secondarily categorizes each study according to the specific CEM task and DL method used to facilitate understanding and access. Finally, the primary obstacles encountered in DL itself and in its practical application in CEM are discussed. It further articulates five critical future research directions that are evolving in tandem with advances in CEM, multimodal construction site management, real-time structural health monitoring and prediction, project progress visualization and management, intelligent design with data sharing and the incorporating large language models (LLM) for text data analysis. The three goals of this study are providing CEM researchers and practitioners with an in-depth and nuanced understanding of DL, elucidating the diverse nature of CEM activities and the resulting benefits of applying DL, and identifying future opportunities for applying DL in CEM to inform subsequent ongoing academic inquiry and pragmatic applications.","Qingze Li, Yang Yang, G.

Adoption of smart technologies in the cruise tourism services: a systematic review and future research agenda,"Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to systematically analyze existing studies related to the adoption of smart technologies in cruise tourism services, particularly robots, artificial intelligence, service automation and virtual reality. More specifically, the authors intend to highlight the current state of research on this topic, present the findings within a conceptual framework and propose a research agenda.
Design/methodology/approach
The relevant literature was extracted using two major electronic databases, web of science (WoS) and Scopus. The authors identified 31 articles from high-quality journals and used a systematic review and the VOSviewer software to analyze them.
Findings
Since 2014, there has been an increase in the number of studies related to smart technologies in cruise tourism services. At first, researchers focused on Royal Caribbean’s robotic bartender arm, whereas other technologies such as digital signage, self-service options, facial recognition and virtual culinary experiences received less attention. However, the interest in exploring these last smart technologies has grown significantly since 2019. The adoption of RAISA in the cruise tourism service (ASCT) framework was proposed, identifying five major domains: cruise robotic technology, technology innovation, cruise passengers’ engagement behavior, cruise passengers’ technology readiness and privacy perception and knowledge expertise. These domains provide valuable guidance for future research in this field.

Innovative Applications of Information Technology in Work Safety Guarantee: A Literature Review,"This literature review delves into creative uses of information technology in challenges at work that ensure the overcoming of problems within traditional practice on safety and safety enhancement. The analysis, however, would be done for the specific role of the technologies as it involves the roles of AI, IoT, AR/VR, wearable devices, and BIM, where there is high-quality risk assessment, monitoring, and training implemented and enhanced. This method involves a systematic review of recent scholarly articles, industry reports, and case studies in the last five years, Findings: It shows that these technologies are useful for monitoring in real-time, predicting risks, and training in an immersive environment in ways compliant with safety regulations across industries. Wearable technologies ensure real-time alerts ensure worker safety; IoT enables continuous monitoring; and AI-based systems enhance predictive analytics. Still, these can be fully leveraged only when the data privacy issue, adaptability of the technology, and interoperability issues are addressed. Therefore, the aftermath of this review demands that organizations include these technologies in reducing workplace hazards, improving operational efficiency, and creating a proactive safety culture.

Local-Global Synergy: The Architectural Evolution and Paradigm Fusion of CNN-Transformer Hybrid Models in the Field of Computer Vision,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction but lack global scope, while Vision Transformers (ViT) capture global context but are computationally expensive and lack crucial inductive biases. To resolve this trade-off, CNN-Transformer hybrid models have emerged to synergize these strengths, becoming a dominant architectural paradigm in computer vision. However, a comprehensive analysis of their evolutionary trajectory and the profound ""spillover"" of their core ""local-global synergy"" philosophy is lacking. This paper provides a systematic review of this evolution, charting its development through four key stages: (1) early modular splicing and replacement, (2) native synergistic design for unified architectures, (3) ideological fusion influencing pure CNN and Transformer paradigms, and (4) the current rise of ""Poly-Hybrids"" integrating emerging operators like State-Space Models (SSMs). We analyze the critical challenges confronting these advanced models, including prohibitive resource barriers, interpretability black boxes, and the fine-grained alignment gap in vision-language tasks. We conclude that the field is at an inflection point, where the pursuit of ""stronger"" models must yield to the necessity of ""more reliable"" ones. Future progress will hinge not just on performance, but on achieving breakthroughs in sustainability, trustworthiness, and alignment, positioning these architectures as the perceptual bedrock for general world models.",Kairui Liu,10.54254/2755-2721/2025.bj25969,https://doi.org/10.54254/2755-2721/2025.bj25969,Applied and Computational Engineering,0,2025,no,"The paper appears to be about computer vision architectures (CNNs and Transformers) rather than academic literature analysis.

Fast clinical trial identification using fuzzy-search elastic searches: retrospective validation with high-quality Cochrane benchmark,"Evidence-based medicine relies on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and other clinical intervention studies to synthesize the latest and most valid estimates of treatment effects. However, conducting these systematic reviews is time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring careful design of sensitive search queries and manual identification of relevant studies. New database architectures and natural language processing (NLP) techniques have recently emerged that may streamline the systematic review process. These new approaches allow fast and fuzzy searches using non-Boolean queries and automatically extracting meta-information from unstructured database texts. Our study compares the effectiveness of NLP-based literature searches within a new database structure to the yield of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews study sets - currently the gold standard. We built a stand-alone, freely available, fuzzy-enabled elastic search database containing all 36 million PubMed-indexed entries. The database is daily synchronized with PubMed. We developed and validated reliable filters to identify randomized clinical trials and other clinical intervention studies and extract Population and Intervention-relevant subtext. Relevant subtexts were detected with a precision of 0.74, recall of 0.81, and F1-score of 0.77 for the Population subtext, and a precision of 0.70, recall of 0.71, and an F1-score of 0.70 for the Intervention subtext. We found that short, user-friendly, and approximate queries were valuable in rapidly identifying a list of included studies within a random set of Cochrane intervention reviews. In 90% of systematic reviews (27/30), the new search strategy missed no more than two of all included trials by Cochrane, yet keeping the total hits lower compared to a comparable PubMed keyword search (87%; 26/30). This identification suggests that NLP-based literature searches within a new database structure on top of PubMed can be a promising approach for conducting and updating aggregated clinical evidence more efficiently and effectively.","Willem M Otte, D.

Deep learning for multimodal perception: Improving lidar and radar integration in self-driving cars,"Autonomous driving relies on a range of advanced technologies, including computer vision, radar, lidar, and deep learning. Each of these components brings distinct strengths and limitations, but when used together, they create powerful synergies. While many self-driving systems employ radar or lidar independently, this separation often leaves critical gaps in perception. Combining radar and lidar with deep learning can significantly enhance a vehicle's environmental awareness by leveraging the complementary properties of each technology, thereby reducing individual weaknesses and improving overall safety. This paper explores the historical evolution and current challenges associated with deep learning, radar, and lidar in autonomous systems. It also examines methods for integrating radar and lidar data through a deep learning approach called multimodal learning, focusing on two key frameworks: M2-Fusion and ST-MVDNet.

"Deep Learning Meets InSAR for Infrastructure Monitoring: A Systematic Review of Models, Applications, and Challenges","Monitoring civil infrastructure is increasingly critical due to aging assets, urban expansion, and the need for early detection of structural instabilities. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) offers high-resolution, all-weather surface deformation monitoring capabilities, which are being enhanced by recent advances in Deep Learning (DL). Despite growing interest, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive synthesis of how DL models are applied specifically to infrastructure monitoring using InSAR data. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing 67 peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and February 2025. We examine the DL architectures employed, ranging from LSTMs and CNNs to Transformer-based and hybrid models, and assess their integration within various stages of the InSAR monitoring pipeline, including pre-processing, temporal analysis, segmentation, prediction, and risk classification. Our findings reveal a predominance of LSTM and CNN-based approaches, limited exploration of pre-processing tasks, and a focus on urban and linear infrastructures. We identify methodological challenges such as data sparsity, low coherence, and lack of standard benchmarks, and we highlight emerging trends including hybrid architectures, attention mechanisms, end-to-end pipelines, and data fusion with exogenous sources. The review concludes by outlining key research opportunities, such as enhancing model explainability, expanding applications to underexplored infrastructure types, and integrating DL-InSAR workflows into operational structural health monitoring systems.","Miguel Fontes, M.

Deep Learning for Automated Image Captioning: A CNN and Transformer Model Analysis,"Automatic image captioning is a multidisciplinary effort that combines machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision in creating meaningful and context-rich captions for images. Within a short time, this research problem has garnered a lot of attention and new techniques are continuously being proposed. However, there are many dismaying factors as well. For instance, the current models still have a long way to go in attaining human accuracy. This paper seeks to conduct a systematic review of the recent trends and developments in the field of image captioning techniques and models with a focus on 2023 and 2024 by systematically analyzing the 13 publications located in Springer and IEEEXplore libraries. According to our research, Convolutional Neural Networks allow the identification of image content at an early stage, and Recurrent Neural Networks or Long Short-Term Memory networks usually appear at the text generation stage. The most common image datasets are MS COCO and Flickr8k. Almost all studies utilized the BLEU scores (1, 2, 3, and 4) mechanism. It is alleviated that CNN with LSTM models tends to perform better when compared to RNN-modeled networks. Attention mechanisms and Encoder-Decoder architecture are aggressively becoming the two major solutions to strengthening image captioning.

User Cold Start Problem in Recommendation Systems: A Systematic Review,"The recommendation system makes recommendations based on the preferences of the users. These user preferences usually come from the user’s basic information, item rating, historical data, and so on. The “user cold start problem” happens when a new user cannot be appropriately suggested due to a lack of more detailed preference information. In many instances, the user cold start problem hinders the use of the recommendation system. Many researchers are currently trying to discover a solution to the user cold start problem. Unfortunately, there are two drawbacks in the current systematic reviews of how to deal with the user cold start problem. First, systematic reviews on how to deal with the user cold start problem are scarce or outdated. Second, existing reviews lack the distinction between the user cold start problem and the item cold start problem. Nevertheless, the solutions to the two problems differ. To address these problems, our study thorough review of all literature published by researchers from January 2016 to April 2023 about 8 years. Firstly, this study analyzes the literatures on approaches that addressed the user cold start problem during the past eight years and divides them into two categories: data-driven technology and approach-driven technology, and then describes and classifies each type of technology in detail. Secondly, this study also analyzes the main evaluation criteria currently used in these methods to provide a reference for researchers in related fields.

Intelligent transportation systems (ITS): A systematic review using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is not a new concept. Notably, ITS has been cited in various journal articles and proceedings papers around the world, and it has become increasingly popular. Additionally, ITS involves multidisciplinary science. The growing number of journal articles makes ITS reviews complicated, and research gaps can be difficult to identify. The existing software for systematic reviews still relies on highly laborious tasks, manual reading, and a homogeneous dataset of research articles. This study proposes a framework that can address these issues, return a comprehensive systematic review of ITS, and promote efficient systematic reviews. The proposed framework consists of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods i.e., Named Entity Recognition (NER), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and word embedding (continuous skip-gram). It enables this study to explore the context of research articles and their overall interpretation to determine and define the directions of knowledge growth and ITS development.

Improving Systematic Literature Review Based on Text Similarity Analysis,"Systematic literature review (SLR) is an important method for identifying, evaluating, and summarizing a specific research subject. However, a SLR study always faces validity threats because there exist subjective biases in certain steps of a SLR, such as identification of relevant studies and primary study selection. In software engineering field, many systematic review studies have adopted several methods to increase the reliability, for example, group decision and pilots search. In this paper, in order to reduce subjective biases, we propose a different solution to improve objectively the quality of SLR, which aims to apply text similarity analysis into two stages of a SLR. We propose that the synonym and hypernym relations of WordNet can be used to expand the search strings to improve the paper search process. In addition, through calculating the relevance of a paper and research issues according to text similarity analysis, the primary study selection can be improved. Then, through the experiment, we validate the effectiveness of our method.

ENHANCED SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES: A REVIEW,"Sign language recognition (SLR) systems leveraging deep learning have made significant strides in recent years, yet critical gaps remain between laboratory performance and real-world applicability. This systematic review analyzes 20 peer-reviewed studies (2021-2024) to evaluate methodological approaches, identify persistent challenges, and propose actionable solutions. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent architectures achieve 88-98% accuracy on constrained datasets, our analysis reveals four fundamental limitations: (1) the accuracy-efficiency trade-off that prevents real-time deployment, (2) inadequate temporal modeling for continuous signing, (3) dataset biases that hinder cross-lingual generalization, and (4) the neglect of non-manual linguistic features. Transformer-based and hybrid models show promise but face computational bottlenecks and data hunger. The review highlights successful techniques like attention mechanisms (improving accuracy by 4-7%) and skeleton-based approaches (reducing computation by 40%), while exposing critical shortcomings in current evaluation protocols. The study proposed four key recommendations: developing edge-optimized lightweight architectures, implementing multimodal fusion for linguistic completeness, expanding diverse dataset curation through community engagement, and adopting self-supervised learning for low-resource scenarios. These findings provide a roadmap for bridging the gap between experimental SLR systems and practical, inclusive deployment, emphasizing the need for closer collaboration between computer scientists, linguists, and deaf communities. The study serves as both a comprehensive reference for SLR researchers and a call to action for more linguistically informed, computationally efficient solutions.","VICTOR JOHNSON, CHRISTOPHER U.

JMTM-04-2020-0164_proof 208..238,"Purpose – The paper attempts to address the following research questions (RQs): RQ1: What are the main research topics within PSS research? RQ2: What are future trends for PSS research? Design/methodology/approach – Twenty years of research (1999–2018) on product-service systems (PSS) produced a significant amount of scientific literature on the topic. As the PSS field is relatively new and fragmented across different disciplines, a review of the prior and relevant literature is important in order to provide the necessary framework for understanding current developments and future perspectives. This paper aims to review and organize research contributions regarding PSS. A machine-learning algorithm, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, has been applied to the whole literature corpus on PSS in order to understand its structure. Findings – The adopted approach resulted in the definition of eight distinct and representative topics able to deal adequately with the multidisciplinarity of the PSS. Furthermore, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to summarize the state-of-the-art and limitations in the identified PSS research topics. Based on this critical analysis, major gaps and future research challenges are presented and discussed.

The research trends in recommender systems for e-learning,"Purpose
A recommendation algorithm is typically applied to speculate on users’ preferences based on their behavioral characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of recommendation systems by collecting related journal articles from the last five years (i.e. from 2014 to 2018). This paper aims to study the correlations between recommendation technologies and e-learning systems.
Design/methodology/approach
The paper reviews the relevant articles using five assessment aspects. A coding scheme was put forward that includes the following: the metrics for the e-learning system, the evaluation metrics for the recommendation algorithms, the recommendation filtering technology, the phases of the recommendation process and the learning outcomes of the system.
Findings
The research indicates that most e-learning systems will adopt the adaptive mechanism as a primary metric, and accuracy is a vital evaluation indicator for recommendation algorithms. In existing e-learning recommender systems, the most common recommendation filtering technology is hybrid filtering. The information collection phase is an important process recognized by most studies. Finally, the learning outcomes of the recommender system can be achieved through two key indicators: affections and correlations.
Originality/value
The recommendation technology works effectively in closing the gap between the information producer and the information consumer.

"An architecture for COVID-19 analysis and detection using big data, AI, and data architectures","The COVID-19 epidemic is affecting individuals in many ways and continues to spread all over the world. Vaccines and traditional medical techniques are still being researched. In diagnosis and therapy, biological and digital technology is used to overcome the fear of this disease. Despite recovery in many patients, COVID-19 does not have a definite cure or a vaccine that provides permanent protection for a large number of people. Current methods focus on prevention, monitoring, and management of the spread of the disease. As a result, new technologies for combating COVID-19 are being developed. Though unreliable due to a lack of sufficient COVID-19 datasets, inconsistencies in the datasets availability, non-aggregation of the database because of conflicting data formats, incomplete information, and distortion, they are a step in the right direction. Furthermore, the privacy and confidentiality of people’s medical data are only partially ensured. As a result, this research study proposes a novel, cooperative approach that combines big data analytics with relevant Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and blockchain to create a system for analyzing and detecting COVID-19 instances. Based on these technologies, the reliability, affordability, and prominence of dealing with the above problems required time. The architecture of the proposed model will analyze different data sources for preliminary diagnosis, detect the affected area, and localize the abnormalities. Furthermore, the blockchain approach supports the decentralization of the central repository so that it is accessible to every stakeholder. The model proposed in this study describes the four-layered architecture. The purpose of the proposed architecture is to utilize the latest technologies to provide a reliable solution during the pandemic; the proposed architecture was sufficient to cover all the current issues, including data security. The layers are unique and individually responsible for handling steps required for data acquisition, storage, analysis, and reporting using blockchain principles in a decentralized P2P network. A systematic review of the technologies to use in the pandemic covers all possible solutions that can cover the issue best and provide a secure solution to the pandemic.","A. M.

Review and prospect of floating car data research in transportation,"With the advancement of intelligent transportation systems, floating car data (FCD), as a crucial source of transportation information, has garnered increasing attention for its applications and development directions within the context of massive traffic data. This study conducts an in-depth literature review analysis of FCD in the transportation field based on the Web of Science (WOS) database from 2000 to 2023, employing bibliometric methods and knowledge graph technologies. The current research status was visually analyzed through the literature distribution by year, research regions and institutions, research hotspots, and literature clustering using the bibliometric tool CiteSpace. Three major research topics were identified based on the literature clustering analysis. A systematic review of key literature was conducted to address research challenges related to floating car sampling proportions and frequencies, and future research challenges and opportunities were proposed. The results show an overall parabolic increase in publication volume, with research hotspots mainly focusing on mountainous cities, cluster analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. The three major research clusters include traffic flow state, traffic safety, and route planning. The optimal investment proportion for floating cars is determined to be 3%–8%, and the sampling frequency significantly affects the accuracy of vehicle speed and heading angle information, while having a weaker impact on positional parameters. With the trend of large-scale Internet-connected vehicle deployment in the future, a massive amount of FCD will be generated, prompting in-depth research on the fusion of heterogeneous data sources, including FCD. Future research could focus on leveraging transformer and graph neural networks to explore spatiotemporal features of data, developing lightweight real-time FCD processing algorithms, and constructing multimodal refined models tailored to specific traffic scenarios.","Chi Zhang, Yuming Zhou, Min Zhang, Bo Wang, Yuhan Nie",10.1016/j.jtte.2024.09.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtte.2024.09.005,Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering,1,2025,yes,"The paper explicitly focuses on academic literature analysis, specifically using the Web of Science (WOS) database for literature review.",yes,"The paper clearly employs bibliometric methods and uses CiteSpace for bibliometric analysis, including literature clustering and citation analysis.",yes,"The study goes beyond basic database management, incorporating advanced bibliometric analysis and knowledge graph technologies.",yes,"The paper explicitly mentions using ""knowledge graph technologies"" for analysis.",maybe,"While the paper mentions machine learning and deep learning as research topics, it's not clear if these are used for the literature analysis itself.",maybe,"The paper includes literature clustering analysis, but doesn't explicitly focus on paper discovery or recommendation algorithms.",yes,"This appears to be a full research paper with substantial technical content, including detailed methodology and analysis.",no,The paper focuses on analyzing floating car data literature rather than technical architectures for literature review systems.,Exclude,"The study demonstrates strong capabilities in bibliometric analysis, knowledge graph technologies, and academic literature review, with comprehensive technical content focused on floating car data research.

Challenges and Future Trends in Fuzzy Logic: A Comprehensive Review,"The real world is a fuzzy world, so to deal with fuzzy reality, what is needed is fuzzy logic. (Lotfi A. Zadeh). Fuzzy logic, since its origin, has proven its utility to handle uncertainty and imprecise information across diverse domains. This review paper aims to provide an in-depth overview of current challenges and future directions within Fuzzy logic. The research methodology was a systematic review of 30 newly published research studies obtained from high-reputation journals and online repositories. A systematic literature review table was constructed to summarise key contributions and identify research gaps in the literature. Key findings suggest that fuzzy logic remains highly active in hybrid systems—particularly with comparisons against neural networks and machine learning—and still struggles with scalability, real-time responsiveness, interpretability, as well as standardization challenges. We explore the limitations of traditional fuzzy systems, including rule-based design complexities and computational complexities, and highlight the advancements in hybrid approaches. We discuss the emerging trends in fuzzy logic, including type-2 fuzzy systems, the integration with machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning, aiming to enhance robustness in AI models. Moreover, we also discuss the applications of fuzzy logic in control systems, decision making, image processing and emerging technologies like IoT and robotics and discuss the problems that affect its potential. This review identifies important future research directions, which include the development of efficient deep fuzzy architectures and the continued refinement of theoretical foundations.

Advanced Surveillance and Detection Systems Using Deep Learning,"The integration of deep learning technologies into surveillance systems represents a transformative advancement in
public safety and security management. This research paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how AI-powered surveillance
systems are revolutionizing security infrastructure globally. Through systematic review of empirical evidence spanning four
decades, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of systems including CCTV, thermal imaging, facial recognition, and smart
policing platforms. The findings indicate that while deep learning-enhanced surveillance demonstrates significant potential in

Mirror Matching: Document Matching Approach in Seed-driven Document Ranking for Medical Systematic Reviews,"When medical researchers conduct a systematic review (SR), screening studies is the most time-consuming process: researchers read several thousands of medical literature and manually label them relevant or irrelevant. Screening prioritization (ie., document ranking) is an approach for assisting researchers by providing document rankings where relevant documents are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. Seed-driven document ranking (SDR) uses a known relevant document (ie., seed) as a query and generates such rankings. Previous work on SDR seeks ways to identify different term weights in a query document and utilizes them in a retrieval model to compute ranking scores. Alternatively, we formulate the SDR task as finding similar documents to a query document and produce rankings based on similarity scores. We propose a document matching measure named Mirror Matching, which calculates matching scores between medical abstract texts by incorporating common writing patterns, such as background, method, result, and conclusion in order. We conduct experiments on CLEF 2019 eHealth Task 2 TAR dataset, and the empirical results show this simple approach achieves the higher performance than traditional and neural retrieval models on Average Precision and Precision-focused metrics.","Grace E.

"Deep Neuro-Fuzzy System application trends, challenges, and future perspectives: a systematic survey","Deep neural networks (DNN) have remarkably progressed in applications involving large and complex datasets but have been criticized as a black-box. This downside has recently become a motivation for the research community to pursue the ideas of hybrid approaches, resulting in novel hybrid systems classified as deep neuro-fuzzy systems (DNFS). Studies regarding the implementation of DNFS have rapidly increased in the domains of computing, healthcare, transportation, and finance with high interpretability and reasonable accuracy. However, relatively few survey studies have been found in the literature to provide a comprehensive insight into this domain. Therefore, this study aims to perform a systematic review to evaluate the current progress, trends, arising issues, research gaps, challenges, and future scope related to DNFS studies. A study mapping process was prepared to guide a systematic search for publications related to DNFS published between 2015 and 2020 using five established scientific directories. As a result, a total of 105 studies were identified and critically analyzed to address research questions with the objectives: (i) to understand the concept of DNFS; (ii) to find out DNFS optimization methods; (iii) to visualize the intensity of work carried out in DNFS domain; and (iv) to highlight DNFS application subjects and domains. We believe that this study provides up-to-date guidance for future research in the DNFS domain, allowing for more effective advancement in techniques and processes. The analysis made in this review proves that DNFS-based research is actively growing with a substantial implementation and application scope in the future.

A Smart Security Framework for IoT Devices,"While the rapid development of the IoT technology and application has played a critical role in the latest economic growth, the potential issues in security and privacy caused by IoT devices have brought extensive attention from both academia and industry recently. Although cryptography algorithms have been widely used in solving security and privacy problems for years, it is extremely challenging in applying them to IoT devices due to the limited resources available on those tiny devices. In this research paper, a new framework was proposed in assisting manufacture industries as well as IoT application developers in evaluating and selecting proper crypto algorithms and implementations for their IoT products. By combining the comparative textual analysis method and the decision tree algorithm, the new framework is well supported by the supervised machine learning approach.

Towards new-generation human-centric smart manufacturing in Industry 5.0: A systematic review,"As businesses started to embrace Industry 4.0, along came the Fifth Industrial Revolution. Industry 5.0 complements the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm for the not-too-distant future by highlighting research and innovation as drivers for a transition to a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient industry. The core values of Industry 5.0 including human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience have prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric. Human-centric smart manufacturing (HSM) takes full advantage of human flexibility, machine precision, and new-generation information technologies to construct a super smart, sustainable, and resilient manufacturing system. Nowadays, extensive research on the concept, architecture, enabling technologies, and applications of smart manufacturing have been conducted. However, research on HSM is relatively lacking, yet starting to gain traction rapidly. Hence, this paper primarily carries out a systematic literature review on HSM to identify promising research topics with high potential for further investigations. Firstly, this paper reveals the concept and connotation of HSM, on which the state-of-the-art architecture of HSM is introduced. Then, several promising Industry 4.0 technologies are identified as the key enablers that can continue to support the construction and operation of HSM, where a comprehensive survey and discussion on these technologies are conducted. Thirdly, what’s new in HSM applications and how HSM will reshape the entire lifecycle of industrial products are explored. Finally, this paper identifies limitations, barriers, and challenges that will be encountered during the developing, operating, and maintaining HSM, and provides valuable research directions to continuously improve HSM.","Chao Zhang, Z.

A Review of Key Technologies for the Analysis and Classification of Social Media Hate Speech Content.,"With the explosive growth of social media content and the enhanced information-sharing capabilities of platforms, the proliferation of online hate speech has become a global governance challenge. Its dissemination patterns are rapidly evolving towards multimodality (the deep integration of text and images), further complicating content security management. On one hand, the subtlety and strong contextual dependence of hate speech significantly increase the difficulty of detection. On the other hand, emerging forms of dissemination, such as meme images, present dual challenges for classification tasks due to their inherent characteristics: a seemingly humorous facade, reliance on cultural context, and semantic conflicts between text and image. To address these issues, this paper focuses on two major technical approaches: unimodal text analysis and multimodal content classification. It provides a systematic review of the research progress in hate speech detection methods based on text and multimodal detection methods, while also analyzing their limitations. Furthermore, this paper consolidates the characteristics and applicable scenarios of current mainstream unimodal and multimodal hate speech datasets, offering reference directions for optimizing technical approaches and constructing datasets in subsequent research.","Yingjie Liu, Chen Gong, Xingyue Ma",10.54097/n8w8j896,https://doi.org/10.54097/n8w8j896,Academic Journal of Science and Technology,0,2025,no,"The paper focuses on hate speech detection in social media, not academic literature.

"Cross-Domain Recommendation: Challenges, Progress, and Prospects","To address the long-standing data sparsity problem in recommender systems (RSs), cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to leverage the relatively richer information from a richer domain to improve the recommendation performance in a sparser domain. Although CDR has been extensively studied in recent years, there is a lack of a systematic review of the existing CDR approaches. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing CDR approaches, including challenges, research progress, and prospects. Specifically, we first summarize existing CDR approaches into four types, including single-target CDR, single-target multi-domain recommendation (MDR), dual-target CDR, and multi-target CDR. We then present the definitions and challenges of these CDR approaches. Next, we propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these approaches and report their research progress in detail.

Railway Track Structural Health Monitoring: Identifying Emerging Trends and Research Agendas Using Bibliometric and Topic Modeling,"While railways are critical for transportation, their expansive networks spanning thousands of kilometers pose significant challenges for conventional structural health inspection and maintenance. Recent advancements in sensors and artificial intelligence technologies have led to a substantial growth in the body of research proposing innovative approaches for Railway Track Structural Health Monitoring (RTSHM) to enhance safety and operational efficiency. This work aims to synthesize the current RTSHM research landscape to explore mainstream and emerging directions and identify advancements, challenges, and opportunities in this field. Through the hybrid systematic review using bibliometrics analysis and topic modeling, core research themes emerged, from developing sensor and data acquisition techniques as the foundation, to be combined with AI-based methods for fault detection and prediction. These predictions are leveraged for predictive maintenance through degradation modeling, supplemented with information from dynamic response assessment and performance optimization, and the ultimate goal is integration of RTSHM for operational safety assessments and risk-based decision-making. While technologically advanced, current research predominantly focuses on detecting discrete defects, thereby neglecting the holistic management of the track system. This fragmentation contributes to a complex and often siloed landscape for infrastructure management, emphasizing that RTSHM remains in a critical developmental stage. Consequently, the development of smart railway, integrated with intelligent data collection devices, deep learning technologies, and innovative operational platforms, represents a challenging yet promising direction for future research.

From Professional Search to Generative Deep Research Systems: How Can Expert Oversight Improve Search Outcomes?,"Generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly employed for professional search tasks, from enterprise copilots to systematic reviews. Recently introduced ''deep research'' products (OpenAI, Google), marketed as automated professional search agents, promise comprehensive query generation and synthesis from large document sets. However, this drive toward automation risks minimizing user involvement, potentially leading to misaligned results and inappropriate reliance on AI-generated outputs. Professional search, especially in domains such as biomedical research and systematic reviews, necessitates expert input, transparency, and user control, requirements often not met by current generative search tools. Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) literature has long emphasized the value of user interactions and iterative search refinement. The rise of generative search introduces innovative methods of accessing information through natural language interactions, which show promise in addressing complex information needs. However, professional search tasks differ substantially from general consumer searches, involving transparent criteria for relevance judgments and systematic data extraction processes. Despite early evidence suggesting increased productivity among knowledge workers using GenAI tools. these systems also exhibit substantial shortcomings. Studies highlight issues such as unsupported claims, inaccurate citations, and overreliance on generated content, questioning the reliability and suitability of current generative search systems for high-stakes professional use. Given these challenges, this work explores systematically integrating structured expert feedback at multiple stages of a generative search process, specifically query formulation, relevance judgments, and information extraction. We aim to shift the focus from full automation toward increased expert control and quality assurance. Our key research questions are:RQ1: How can expert feedback be systematically integrated into GenAI-driven retrieval systems to improve result quality? RQ2: How does a feedback-driven generative search system compare to fully automated approaches in terms of retrieval effectiveness and task performance? RQ3: Does the integration of human expert feedback improve professional search outcomes compared to GenAI-simulated expert feedback? Building on our earlier experiments that assessed the performance of GenAI models in a fully automated setting for biomedical question answering and introduced an interactive system for refining generated queries, we now seek to evaluate how a structured, human-in-the-loop feedback approach might improve retrieval and task effectiveness over fully automated pipelines. By evaluating our proposed framework on biomedical Q&A datasets such as CLEF BioASQ and TREC BioGen as well as systematic review datasets, we want to highlight the value of human guidance for professional generative search.",Samy Ateia,10.1145/3726302.3730131,https://doi.org/10.1145/3726302.3730131,Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,0,2025,yes,"The paper explicitly focuses on academic literature, specifically mentioning biomedical research and systematic reviews.

Towards a multi-level framework for supporting systematic review — A pilot study,"As part of the forefront of evidence-based medicine, a systematic review (SR) identifies, appraises, and synthesizes all the available literature relevant to a question of interest in a transparent and systematic way. A time-consuming step in conducting systematic review (SR) is the manual article screening from a list of potentially relevant articles retrieved by librarians. In this study, we propose a multi-level SR supporting framework including three levels: Level 1 - ranking with multiple metrics aiming to assist the screening process by increasing the efficiency without compromising the validity; Level 2 - topic analysis for discovering distributed semantics; and Level 3 - network analysis on relation extracted for comprehensive semantic summarization. The sensitivities in two case studies for relevance ranking reached above 80%, while the screening burdens were lowered to 25% based on a crude relevance ranking approach. Topic analysis based on Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDAs) showed high consistency among the domain experts' selection of articles. The predicate relation network summarized important predicate relations between medical concepts.","Dingcheng Li, Zhen Wang, F. Shen, M.

A Systematic Review of Advances in Deep Learning Architectures for Efficient and Sustainable Photovoltaic Solar Tracking: Research Challenges and Future Directions,"The swift advancement of renewable energy technology has highlighted the need for effective photovoltaic (PV) solar energy tracking systems. Deep learning (DL) has surfaced as a promising method to improve the precision and efficacy of photovoltaic (PV) solar tracking by utilising complicated patterns in meteorological and PV system data. This systematic literature review (SLR) seeks to offer a thorough examination of the progress in deep learning architectures for photovoltaic solar energy tracking over the last decade (2016–2025). The review was structured around four research questions (RQs) aimed at identifying prevalent deep learning architectures, datasets, performance metrics, and issues within the context of deep learning-based PV solar tracking systems. The present research utilised SLR methodology to analyse 64 high-quality publications from reputed academic databases like IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer, and MDPI. The results indicated that deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based models, are extensively employed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of photovoltaic solar tracking systems. Widely utilised datasets comprised meteorological data, photovoltaic system data, time series data, temperature data, and image data. Performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), were employed to assess model efficacy. Identified significant challenges encompass inadequate data quality, restricted availability, high computing complexity, and issues in model generalisation. Future research should concentrate on enhancing data quality and accessibility, creating generalised models, minimising computational complexity, and integrating deep learning with real-time photovoltaic systems. Resolving these challenges would facilitate advancements in efficient, reliable, and sustainable photovoltaic solar tracking systems, hence promoting the wider adoption of renewable energy technology.

Deep Learning and Sustainability in Agriculture: A Systematic Review,"Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the global economy, and with the increasing human population, there is substantial pressure to enhance agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impacts. Digital agriculture and precision farming have emerged as innovative fields leveraging data-intensive approaches to optimize agricultural operations. However, there is a gap in understanding how machine learning (ML) techniques can be effectively integrated across various agricultural domains, including crop management, livestock monitoring, soil analysis, and water management. To address this gap, this study provides a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in different agricultural domains. By analyzing publications from 2016 to 2023, we identify key trends, challenges, and future directions for ML in agriculture. The methodology involves categorizing 40 papers from top reputable journals and conferences into four main domains: crop, livestock, soil, and water, and examining the specific ML techniques applied in each domain. Our results show that crop management is the most researched domain, with significant use of machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning, and transfer learning techniques. Livestock monitoring and soil analysis also employ advanced ML methods, though they face unique challenges related to data quality and model generalizability. Water management benefits from ML for optimizing resource use but encounters difficulties in data integration and scalability. The significance of this study lies in its holistic analysis of ML applications in agriculture, highlighting the most effective techniques and identifying critical challenges that need to be addressed.

Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey,"Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG.

Deep Learning Approach in DOA Estimation: A Systematic Literature Review,"In array signal processing, the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal source has drawn broad research interests with its wide applications in fields such as sonar, radar, communications, medical detection, and electronic countermeasures. In recent years, the application of deep learning (DL) to DOA estimation has achieved great success. This study provides a systematic review of research on DOA estimation using deep neural network methods. We manually selected twenty-five papers related to this research from five prominent databases (SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar) for exploration. Six questions describing the overall trend of DOA estimation using deep learning are put forward. Then, we answered these questions by reviewing the literature. This review is helpful for researchers in this field because it provides more specific and comprehensive information needed for future research. Specifically, we first analyzed the background of the selected papers, including the type of publication, the number of citations, and the country of origin. Then, the DL technology used in DOA estimation is systematically analyzed, including the purpose of using DL in DOA estimation, various DL models (convolutional neural network, deep neural network, and combination network), and various DOA estimation schemes. Finally, various evaluation criteria (root-mean-squared error, accuracy, and mean absolute error) are used to evaluate the DL technology in DOA estimation, and various factors (signal-to-noise ratio, number of snapshots, number of antennas, and number of signal sources) affecting DOA estimation are analyzed. Based on our findings, we believe that deep learning can perform DOA estimation well, and there is still room for improvement in deep learning technology.

Exploring the intellectual cores of the blockchain-Internet of Things (BIoT),"PurposeDue to the rapid growth of blockchain technology in recent years, the fusion of blockchain and the Internet of Things (BIoT) has drawn considerable attention from researchers and industrial practitioners and is regarded as a future trend in technological development. Although several authors have conducted literature reviews on the topic, none have examined the development of the knowledge structure of BIoT, resulting in scattered research and development (R&D) efforts.Design/methodology/approachThis study investigates the intellectual core of BIoT through a co-citation proximity analysis–based systematic review (CPASR) of the correlations between 44 highly influential articles out of 473 relevant research studies.

A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services,"Modern service systems are constantly improving with the development of various IT technologies, leading to a boost in system scales and complex dependencies among service components. The large scale and complexity of services make them more prone to failure. To maintain services’ normal and stable operation, alert and incident management (AIM), which analyzes and handles service failures in time, has become an important content of IT service management (ITSM). Many intelligent solutions have been proposed to improve the management process. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that systematically reviews related works. Moreover, no integrated AIM architecture can cover each detailed process or most existing piecemeal solutions. Therefore, we conduct an in-depth survey to address these problems. To the best of our knowledge, the paper is the most comprehensive survey on intelligent AIM in IT services. Through this survey, we make the following contributions. First, we summarize an integrated architecture that includes detailed AIM processes and key techniques. Second, we provide a systematic review of related works based on the architecture. Third, we give a valuable analysis of current challenges and trends in AIM.","Qingyang Yu, Nengwen Zhao, Mingjie Li, Zeyan Li, Honglin Wang, Wenchi Zhang, Kaixin Sui, Dan Pei",10.1016/j.jnca.2024.103842,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2024.103842,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2,2024,no,"The paper appears to be a survey of IT service management literature, but it's not specifically focused on academic literature analysis systems.

Beyond Synthesis: Elevating Scholarly Contributions in the Age of AI,"""You can raise the bar or you can wait for others to raise it, but it's getting raised regardless."" Quote by Seth Godin Since 2020, the Annual Review and Conceptual Development Issue (ARCDI) of the Journal of Organizational Behavior has welcomed submissions of both review papers and conceptual development papers, recognizing their distinct yet complementary roles in advancing knowledge about organizational behavior (Dasborough 2020). During this time, the ARDCI has served as a platform for scholars to contribute to theoretical development and future empirical enrichment of our field. The reviews and conceptual development articles published in the ARDCI have stimulated future research endeavors by building upon existing scholarly conversations and raising new questions to be investigated. Despite the widening scope of the Annual Review issue to be inclusive of conceptual development submissions, most of the manuscripts submitted to the ARCDI continue to be scholarly reviews. These range from qualitative narrative review articles to quantitative meta-analytic articles and every other type of review in between (see Grant and Booth 2009). Purposeful and rigorous review articles provide valuable syntheses of existing research, helping to consolidate what we know (Rousseau 2024). Review articles published in the ARCDI (and other review outlets) are often highly cited in the literature, as many scholars turn to reviews because they summarize a lot of information on a topic and they contain comprehensive reference lists (Lei and Sun 2020; Moussa 2021). Hence, writing review articles has been a very attractive option for scholars wishing to enhance their reputation as scholarly contributors to the field. AI tools can now assist researchers across almost every stage of preparing a review article (Dasborough 2024). AI tools can synthesize large volumes of scholarly articles and automate the production of systematic and comprehensive literature reviews (e.g., Pallath and Zhang 2023). For instance, platforms like Research Rabbit and Connected Papers enable researchers to identify trends, gaps, and influential works by visualizing relationships among studies and uncovering less obvious connections. This can help with selecting specific topic areas to review. Other tools such as Elicit, Paperfetcher, Eppi-Reviewer, Rayyan, and Scite automate data extraction from large datasets, making systematic reviews and meta-analyses faster and more comprehensive (Rousseau 2024). Similarly, it is evident that tools like ChatGPT, Quillbot, and Semantic Scholar are being used to summarize academic articles, potentially reducing the time that scholars spend reading and extracting key insights from lengthy articles—although this can be a risky practice that I do not encourage. Please read every article you cite! (see Rekdal 2014). As mentioned in prior editorials, commentaries, and articles, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the landscape of academic writing (Dasborough 2023; Grimes et al. 2023; Rousseau 2024). Consequently, this is changing the relative value of different types of contributions to the ARCDI. Since AI tools can help to identify patterns, summarize findings, and highlight gaps within the existing literature (Dasborough 2023), this changes the value proposition of review articles because these articles now require much less time1 and cognitive effort to write than they did before. In 2025, the standard for publishing articles that review areas of scholarly literature is being set at a significantly much higher level. Given the rise in the use of various AI tools, review papers, in their traditional form, are becoming less intellectually demanding and therefore less valuable as a scholarly output. As the editor of the ARCDI, I need to adapt to this new reality by shifting focus to encouraging submissions that demonstrate a level of cognitive complexity and creativity that AI cannot replicate. Moving forward, I encourage submissions to the ARCDI that go beyond merely summarizing the literature as some reviews have in the past (Dasborough 2023, 2024). Instead, I urge authors to leverage systematic reviews as a foundation for generating innovative conceptual and theoretical insights or addressing unresolved paradoxes in our field. Moving forward, this is where I see the most valuable unique intellectual contribution being made. Conceptual development and theoretical development are two distinct yet closely related types of scholarly contributions that can advance our understanding of organizational behavior. Conceptual development articles focus on clearly identifying, defining, and framing new constructs (see Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Podsakoff 2016). In contrast, theoretical development articles involve proposing frameworks or models that explain phenomena, by integrating multiple constructs and specifying causal mechanisms between them (Smith and Hitt 2005). While conceptual development lays the foundation for future scholarly inquiry, theoretical development builds upon it to provide explanations and predictions that may stimulate future empirical studies. Therefore, both types are crucial for scholarly progress. These types of papers can challenge existing paradigms, propose novel frameworks, or integrate insights across disciplines to address complex organizational phenomena (Grimes et al. 2023; Rousseau 2024; Smith and Hitt 2005). They demand not only a mastery of the literature but also the ability to engage in abstract reasoning, make bold intellectual leaps, and construct compelling arguments that advance the boundaries of what we know. In this regard, conceptual and theoretical development papers represent the kind of output that AI, for all its strengths, is unlikely to produce autonomously. They require human ingenuity, intuition, and a nuanced understanding of the organizational context—qualities that remain uniquely human. This is not to say that systematic reviews have no place in the ARCDI. On the contrary, systematic reviews that are purposefully crafted to inform conceptual and theoretical development can be incredibly impactful. For example, a systematic review could identify an emergent but underexplored phenomenon, serving as the foundation for a novel theoretical model (Grant and Booth 2009). Alternatively, it could synthesize insights from adjacent fields, paving the way for cross-disciplinary innovation. In these ways, AI can augment (not substitute) scholar's endeavors to produce impactful work (see Bankins et al. 2024; Von Krogh 2018). The key is for systematic reviews—which may or may not be AI-assisted—to go beyond simple description and summation, by contributing to the generative aspects of theory building. By doing so, these reviews not only remain relevant but also elevate their contribution to broader academic conversations. AI tools should be used to empower scholars to focus on higher-order intellectual tasks, such as critical analysis, conceptual development, and theoretical development while minimizing repetitive and time-consuming processes (Grimes et al. 2023). As we look to the future of the ARCDI, I envision it being an outlet where an abundance of scholarly information provided by AI tools (in a transparent manner) meets passion, creativity, critical thinking, and intellectual rigor. I encourage authors to embrace the opportunities for the efficiencies presented by AI, while simultaneously striving to produce scholarly work that challenges, provokes, inspires, and excites. This issue of the ARCDI presents eight articles that cover a broad range of OB topics. These articles include both reviews and conceptual development papers, with each article offering a unique value proposition as identified by our review teams. The articles are presented in the most logical order that I could think of, starting with within-individual-level phenomena and individual responses, moving on to interpersonal dynamics, and then finishing with group and organizational-level issues. The first two articles focus on how daily fluctuations, timing of work, and recovery processes shape the work experience. First, Sonnentag, Völker, and Wehrt offer a comprehensive descriptive review of experience-sampling studies, analyzing what makes for a ""good"" versus ""bad"" day at work. Their review identifies prework factors (e.g., sleep), at-work factors (e.g., work breaks), and their contributions to daily outcomes. By linking their findings to a homeostatic human sustainability perspective, this article provides valuable insights into how daily experiences shape work life. The second article by Calderwood et al. examines the role of contextual factors—specifically work scheduling dynamics—in influencing recovery processes, an essential element of sustaining well-being across workdays. While Sonnentag et al. emphasize the interplay of events in shaping positive and negative workdays, Calderwood et al. extend this perspective by addressing how scheduling structures can constrain or enable resource replenishment. Together, these first two articles offer complementary insights into how organizations can promote employee well-being through intentional scheduling and support of positive day-level experiences. Given that we all (should) want to have good days at work and value well-being, these articles will be of interest to our entire JOB audience. Building on the insights into daily experiences, timing, and recovery, the next pair of articles explore how interpersonal dynamics, such as risk, rank, and trust, influence decision-making in the workplace, highlighting how individual behaviors intersect with relational factors. In their article, Hamstra and Higgins develop a theoretical framework to understand how rank positions in organizations influence decision-making, particularly in choosing between risky and less risky options. By examining the motivational effects of rank through a multilevel analysis—spa",M.

Recent Developments in Deep Learning-based Author Name Disambiguation,"Author Name Disambiguation (AND) is a critical task for digital libraries aiming to link existing authors with their respective publications. Due to the lack of persistent identifiers used by researchers and the presence of intrinsic linguistic challenges, such as homonymy, the development of Deep Learning algorithms to address this issue has become widespread. Many AND deep learning methods have been developed, and surveys exist comparing the approaches in terms of techniques, complexity, performance. However, none explicitly addresses AND methods in the context of deep learning in the latest years (i.e. timeframe 2016-2024). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of state-of-the-art AND techniques based on deep learning, highlighting recent improvements, challenges, and open issues in the field. We find that DL methods have significantly impacted AND by enabling the integration of structured and unstructured data, and hybrid approaches effectively balance supervised and unsupervised learning.","Francesca Cappelli, Giovanni Colavizza, Silvio Peroni",10.48550/arXiv.2503.13448,https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.13448,Italian Research Conference on Digital Library Management Systems,4,2024,yes,"The paper is clearly focused on academic literature, specifically dealing with author name disambiguation in digital libraries and publications.",maybe,"While the paper deals with bibliographic data, it doesn't explicitly focus on citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

Thereafter, the future development prospects in water allocation and integrative management could be systematically analyzed and subsequently explored. Some frontier techniques such as data-oriented irrigation management, performance-proven water allocation, and cloud-based irrigation control are among the critical technologies capable of building a sustainable, integrative, and evolutionary irrigation system while providing the higher quality and efficiency needed for a full application of precision irrigation.

The Road to Autonomy: A Systematic Review Through AI in Autonomous Vehicles,"In the last decade, the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with autonomous vehicles (AVs) has transformed transportation, mobility, and smart mobility systems. The present study provides a systematic review of global trends, applications, and challenges at the intersection of AI, including Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and autonomous vehicle technologies. Using data extracted from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science Core Collection and a set of specific keywords related to both AI and autonomous (electric) vehicles, this paper identifies the themes presented in the scientific literature using thematic maps and thematic map evolution analysis. Furthermore, the research topics are identified using both thematic maps, as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic, offering a more faceted insight into the research field as LDA enables the probabilistic discovery of high-level research themes, while BERTopic, based on transformer-based language models, captures deeper semantic patterns and emerging topics over time. This approach offers richer insights into the systematic review analysis, while comparison in the results obtained through the various methods considered leads to a better overview of the themes associated with the field of AI in autonomous vehicles. As a result, a strong correspondence can be observed between core topics, such as object detection, driving models, control, safety, cybersecurity and system vulnerabilities. The findings offer a roadmap for researchers and industry practitioners, by outlining critical gaps and discussing the opportunities for future exploration.","Adrian Domenteanu, Paul Diaconu, M.

Research Progress on Intelligent Variable-Rate Spray Technology for Precision Agriculture,"Conventional continuous pesticide application remains prevalent in agriculture, but its limitations in addressing the spatial–temporal variability of biotic stressors have led to excessive chemical inputs and inefficiency. The emergence of precision agriculture has catalyzed significant advancements in variable-rate spray systems to optimize agrochemical deployment through real-time modulation. This technology demonstrates critical advantages in minimizing the environmental footprint while maintaining crop protection efficacy. Our systematic review analyzes three foundational variable-rate spray architectures—pressure-regulated, flow rate-regulated, and pesticide concentration-regulated mechanisms—evaluating their maturity and implementation paradigms. Pressure-regulated technology relies on the pressure–flow relationship to achieve regulation, but there is a narrow range in flow regulation, atomization stability is insufficient, and there are other defects. Flow rate-regulated technology achieves precise control through the dynamic adjustment of the nozzle orifice area or Pulse-Width Modulation duty cycles, but this technology faces mechanical wear, a nonlinear flow–duty cycle relationship, and other challenges. Pesticide concentration-regulated technology is centered on real-time mixing, which can avoid the residue of chemicals but is highly dependent on fluid characteristics and mixing efficiency. This study proposes improvement paths from the perspectives of hardware optimization, control strategy integration, and material innovation. Through the summary and analysis of this paper, we hope to provide valuable references for future research on variable-rate spray technology.","Yuxuan Jiao, Songchao Zhang, Yongkui Jin, L.

Hybrid Deep Learning (hDL)-Based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Systems: A Systematic Review,"Background: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is becoming more reliable, thanks to the advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, hybrid Deep Learning (hDL), which combines different DL algorithms, has gained momentum over the past five years. In this work, we proposed a review on hDL-based BCI starting from the seminal studies in 2015. Objectives: We have reviewed 47 papers that apply hDL to the BCI system published between 2015 and 2020 extracting trends and highlighting relevant aspects to the topic. Methods: We have queried four scientific search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore and Elsevier Science Direct) and different data items were extracted from each paper such as the database used, kind of application, online/offline training, tasks used for the BCI, pre-processing methodology adopted, type of normalization used, which kind of features were extracted, type of DL architecture used, number of layers implemented and which optimization approach were used as well. All these items were then investigated one by one to uncover trends. Results: Our investigation reveals that Electroencephalography (EEG) has been the most used technique. Interestingly, despite the lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the EEG data that makes pre-processing of that data mandatory, we have found that the pre-processing has only been used in 21.28% of the cases by showing that hDL seems to be able to overcome this intrinsic drawback of the EEG data. Temporal-features seem to be the most effective with 93.94% accuracy, while spatial-temporal features are the most used with 33.33% of the cases investigated. The most used architecture has been Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network CNN-RNN with 47% of the cases. Moreover, half of the studies have used a low number of layers to achieve a good compromise between the complexity of the network and computational efficiency. Significance: To give useful information to the scientific community, we make our summary table of hDL-based BCI papers available and invite the community to published work to contribute to it directly. We have indicated a list of open challenges, emphasizing the need to use neuroimaging techniques other than EEG, such as functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), deeper investigate the advantages and disadvantages of using pre-processing and the relationship with the accuracy obtained. To implement new combinations of architectures, such as RNN-based and Deep Belief Network DBN-based, it is necessary to better explore the frequency and temporal-frequency features of the data at hand.","Nibras Abo Alzahab, Luca Apollonio, A.

Integrating Edge Computing and Software Defined Networking in Internet of Things: A Systematic Review,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed our interaction with the world by connecting devices,
sensors, and systems to the Internet, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and automation in various applications
such as smart cities, healthcare, transportation, homes, and grids. However, challenges related to latency, privacy,
and bandwidth have arisen due to the massive influx of data generated by IoT devices and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based architectures. Moreover, network management, interoperability, security, and scalability
issues have emerged due to the rapid growth and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices. To overcome such
problems, researchers proposed a new architecture called Software Defined Networking for Edge Computing in the
Internet of Things (SDN-EC-IoT), which combines Edge Computing for the Internet of Things (EC-IoT) and
Software Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT). Although researchers have studied EC-IoT and SDIoT as individual
architectures, they have not yet addressed the combination of both, creating a significant gap in our understanding
of SDN-EC-IoT. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive review of how the SDN-EC-IoT
paradigm can solve IoT challenges. To achieve this goal, this study conducted a literature review covering 74
articles published between 2019 and 2023. Finally, this paper identifies future research directions for SDN-EC-IoT,

"A Systematic Review of Deep Knowledge Graph-Based Recommender Systems, with Focus on Explainable Embeddings","Recommender systems (RS) have been developed to make personalized suggestions and enrich users’ preferences in various online applications to address the information explosion problems. However, traditional recommender-based systems act as black boxes, not presenting the user with insights into the system logic or reasons for recommendations. Recently, generating explainable recommendations with deep knowledge graphs (DKG) has attracted significant attention. DKG is a subset of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) that utilizes the strengths of deep learning (DL) algorithms to learn, provide high-quality predictions, and complement the weaknesses of knowledge graphs (KGs) in the explainability of recommendations. DKG-based models can provide more meaningful, insightful, and trustworthy justifications for recommended items and alleviate the information explosion problems. Although several studies have been carried out on RS, only a few papers have been published on DKG-based methodologies, and a review in this new research direction is still insufficiently explored. To fill this literature gap, this paper uses a systematic literature review framework to survey the recently published papers from 2018 to 2022 in the landscape of DKG and XAI. We analyze how the methods produced in these papers extract essential information from graph-based representations to improve recommendations’ accuracy, explainability, and reliability. From the perspective of the leveraged knowledge-graph related information and how the knowledge-graph or path embeddings are learned and integrated with the DL methods, we carefully select and classify these published works into four main categories: the Two-stage explainable learning methods, the Joint-stage explainable learning methods, the Path-embedding explainable learning methods, and the Propagation explainable learning methods. We further summarize these works according to the characteristics of the approaches and the recommendation scenarios to facilitate the ease of checking the literature. We finally conclude by discussing some open challenges left for future research in this vibrant field.","R.

The emergence of large language models as tools in literature reviews: a large language model-assisted systematic review,"Abstract Objectives This study aims to summarize the usage of large language models (LLMs) in the process of creating a scientific review by looking at the methodological papers that describe the use of LLMs in review automation and the review papers that mention they were made with the support of LLMs. Materials and Methods The search was conducted in June 2024 in PubMed, Scopus, Dimensions, and Google Scholar by human reviewers. Screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of LLM add-on based on the OpenAI GPT-4o model. ChatGPT and Scite.ai were used in cleaning the data, generating the code for figures, and drafting the manuscript. Results Of the 3788 articles retrieved, 172 studies were deemed eligible for the final review. ChatGPT and GPT-based LLM emerged as the most dominant architecture for review automation (n = 126, 73.2%). A significant number of review automation projects were found, but only a limited number of papers (n = 26, 15.1%) were actual reviews that acknowledged LLM usage. Most citations focused on the automation of a particular stage of review, such as Searching for publications (n = 60, 34.9%) and Data extraction (n = 54, 31.4%). When comparing the pooled performance of GPT-based and BERT-based models, the former was better in data extraction with a mean precision of 83.0% (SD = 10.4) and a recall of 86.0% (SD = 9.8). Discussion and Conclusion Our LLM-assisted systematic review revealed a significant number of research projects related to review automation using LLMs. Despite limitations, such as lower accuracy of extraction for numeric data, we anticipate that LLMs will soon change the way scientific reviews are conducted.","Dmitry Scherbakov, Nina C.

A systematic review of hyperspectral imaging in precision agriculture: Analysis of its current state and future prospects,"Hyperspectral sensor adaptability in precision agriculture to digital images is still at its nascent stage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is data rich in solving agricultural problems like disease detection, weed detection, stress detection, crop monitoring, nutrient application, soil mineralogy, yield estimation, and sorting applications. With modern precision agriculture, the challenge now is to bring these applications to the field for real-time solutions, where machines are enabled to conduct analyses without expert supervision and communicate the results to users for better management of farmlands; a necessary step to gain complete autonomy in agricultural farmlands. Significant advancements in HSI technology for precision agriculture are required to fully realize its potential. As a wide-ranging collection of the status of HSI and analysis in precision agriculture is lacking, this review endeavors to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements and trends of HSI in precision agriculture for real-time applications. In this study, a systematic review of 163 scientific articles published over the past twenty years (2003–2023) was conducted.

A systematic review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches in Plant Species Detection,"Due to global warming and adverse climatic conditions, researchers have focused on the survival of plant species. Certain plant species are nearly extinct and thus must be saved. However, this requires a comprehensive understanding of the species, which involves expertise and time. Many researchers have expressed their interest in developing automated plant species recognition techniques by analyzing various issues, such as expertise, complex venation structure, interclass and intraclass similarity, occluded leaves, problems with feature extraction of premature and dried leaves, etc. Classifiers and other machine learning and deep learning algorithms that can accurately categorize and extract data can be further developed. In this article, we presented a systematic review of effective machine learning methods and image processing and deep learning algorithms for plant species recognition that have been used by researchers. The most common research problems, recommendation techniques, methodological analysis, and datasets presented in these selected studies were examined. The review and analysis indicated that there is scope for improvement in the case of multi-feature fusion, such as concatenation of shape, size, margin, texture, venation contour, etc. The extraction of characteristics of leaves in different stages, such as seedlings, tiny, mature, and dried, can be considered for feature extraction. Hybridization of machine intelligence approaches can also be implemented for multifeatured fusion extraction which might increase the performance of the system. We also investigated evaluation metrics, challenges, trends, and the most interesting ideas for future studies.","Deepti Barhate, Sunil Pathak, B. Singh, Amit Jain, A.

Eighty-six studies were included in our systematic review and 17 studies were further included for meta-analysis. The combined recall, specificity, and precision were 0.928 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.878-0.958], 0.647 (95% CI, 0.442-0.809), and 0.200 (95% CI, 0.135-0.287) when achieving maximized recall, but were 0.708 (95% CI, 0.570-0.816), 0.921 (95% CI, 0.824-0.967), and 0.461 (95% CI, 0.375-0.549) when achieving maximized precision in the AI models. No significant difference was found in recall among subgroup analyses including the algorithms, the number of screened literatures, and the fraction of included literatures.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis study showed that the recall is more important than the specificity or precision in literature screening, and a recall over 0.95 should be prioritized. We recommend to report the effectiveness indices of automatic algorithms separately. At the current stage manual literature screening is still indispensable for medical systematic reviews.","Yunying Feng, Siyu Liang, Yuelun Zhang, Shi Chen, Qing Wang, Tianze Huang, F.

Deep learning in surgical process modeling: A systematic review of workflow recognition,"OBJECTIVE
The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has led to a surge of interest in surgical process modeling (SPM). The objective of this study is to investigate the role of deep learning in recognizing surgical workflows and extracting reliable patterns from datasets used in minimally invasive surgery, thereby advancing the development of context-aware intelligent systems in endoscopic surgeries.
METHODS
We conducted a comprehensive search of articles related to SPM from 2018 to April 2024 in the PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore databases. We chose surgical videos with annotations to describe the article on surgical process modeling and focused on examining the specific methods and research results of each study.
RESULTS
The search initially yielded 2937 articles. After filtering on the basis of the relevance of titles, abstracts, and content, 59 articles were selected for full-text review. These studies highlight the widespread adoption of neural networks, and transformers for surgical workflow analysis (SWA). They focus on minimally invasive surgeries performed with laparoscopes and microscopes. However, the process of surgical annotation lacks detailed description, and there are significant differences in the annotation process for different surgical procedures.
CONCLUSION
Time and spatial sequences are key factors determining the identification of surgical phase. RNN, TCN, and transformer networks are commonly used to extract long-distance temporal relationships. Multimodal data input is beneficial, as it combines information from surgical instruments. However, publicly available datasets often lack clinical knowledge, and establishing large annotated datasets for surgery remains a challenge. To reduce annotation costs, methods such as semi supervised learning, self-supervised learning, contrastive learning, transfer learning, and active learning are commonly used.

Deep Learning and Ensemble Approaches to Misinformation Detection in Digital News: A Systematic Review,"Online services are only getting better and faster at distributing information, causing their users to consume said information as presented. This reduction of society’s media literacy leaves us prone to misinformation at unprecedented levels. Misinformation commonly comes in the form of stealthily hidden content known as Native Advertisements or blatantly misleading information on news sites commonly referred to as Fake News. The study aims to provide a detailed Systematic Literature Review to explore how misinformed content in digital news is addressed. Deep Learning and Ensembles, specifically Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are the most popular methods of detection, often used in tandem with each other or other methods to create a hybrid model. Numerous feature extraction methods have been done, including news structure extraction and statistical analysis, each of which was frequently incorporated with deep learning to obtain high- and low-level feature extraction. Methods such as graph-based and quantum fusion models have the potential to be explored further.

A systematic literature review on current developments of low code-no code solutions in the IT sector,"The growing scarcity of skilled software developers has prompted organizations to turn to low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms, which allow non-technical users to develop applications without requiring extensive knowledge of coding. LCNC platforms use AI and ML to automate the development process, thereby encouraging innovation and collaboration between IT and business teams. These platforms offer a plethora of benefits-including reduced times for development with drawbacks like vendor lock-in, higher security risks, and less competence in dealing with complex applications. Such research investigates business process changes facilitated by LCNC platforms in pursuit of filling knowledge gaps regarding the way they support improving organizational performance and leading innovation. A systematic review of the existing literature shows both developing trends and obstacles in the adaptation of LCNC platforms in the IT sector.
According to findings, these platforms incorporate the entire process of software development, which makes collaboration better and highly decreases the project timelines for organizations, providing them with a window opportunity to enhance efficiency and innovation in their operations. However, organizations need to address governance, security concerns, and scalability issues for the optimal integration of LCNC.

Data Harmonization for Heterogeneous Datasets: A Systematic Literature Review,"As data size increases drastically, its variety also increases. Investigating such heterogeneous data is one of the most challenging tasks in information management and data analytics. The heterogeneity and decentralization of data sources affect data visualization and prediction, thereby influencing analytical results accordingly. Data harmonization (DH) corresponds to a field that unifies the representation of such a disparate nature of data. Over the years, multiple solutions have been developed to minimize the heterogeneity aspects and disparity in formats of big-data types. In this study, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess the state-of-the-art DH techniques. This study aimed to understand the issues faced due to heterogeneity, the need for DH and the techniques that deal with substantial heterogeneous textual datasets. The process produced 1355 articles, but among them, only 70 articles were found to be relevant through inclusion and exclusion criteria methods. The result shows that the heterogeneity of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (SSU) data can be managed by using DH and its core techniques, such as text preprocessing, Natural Language Preprocessing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). These techniques are applied to many real-world applications centered on the information-retrieval domain. Several assessment criteria were implemented to measure the efficiency of these techniques, such as precision, recall, F-1, accuracy, and time. A detailed explanation of each research question, common techniques, and performance measures is also discussed. Lastly, we present readers with a detailed discussion of the existing work, contributions, and managerial and academic implications, along with the conclusion, limitations, and future research directions.","Ganesh M.

Exploring the Potential of Deep Learning for Personalized Learning Environments,"Abstract This study investigates the current potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to support personalized learning (PL). Personalized learning can provide a customized learning environment to support student learning processes based on individual needs, competencies, and interests. One way to conduct personalized learning is by using a recommender system that employs deep learning, an AI technique. To date, a limited number of researchers have discussed the application of deep learning methods to develop advanced recommenders in personalized learning environments. This study examines the literature that describe deep learning as a recommender system to support personalized learning environments. This initial phase of the project seeks to synthesize the issues and opportunities associated with personalized learning experiences and the potential of using deep learning to support the process. Because the topic intersects the education and information technology (IT) fields, we selected three databases for this literature review project: Scopus, ERIC, and Engineering Village. We used the phrase ""deep learning recommender system for personalized learning environments"" as our search string. We focused only on papers that experts had evaluated in the field to ensure accuracy. Therefore, terms such as ""peer review,"" ""literature review,"" and ""systematic review"" were added to the original search string. The initial search results included 409 documents. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 20 papers emerged as the focus of this study. Thematic analysis was used to look for various themes to identify how deep learning methods are used in education and their potential to inform personalized learning environments. The analysis process utilized Mendeley and NVivo to quickly capture themes by focusing on six features to peruse within the articles. The features involved research questions, goals of studies, research methodology, research design, primary outcomes, and limitations. We then generated three themes from the six features in the analysis phase of the 20 papers, first, regarding the type of study. We grouped the articles into primary and secondary studies. By these categorizations, we could identify the types of studies that employed deep learning methods in the development of recommender systems and their integration with personalized learning. Second, recommender system (RS) techniques mainly emerged in the articles. This theme highlighted the AI methodologies that were most frequently utilized in previous research. And the third theme was a list of e-learning platforms that applied RS for personalized learning. The main findings revealed that the deep learning method was effective in big data analysis due to its ability to forecast students' achievements, behaviors, and future paths. Therefore, we considered that deep learning could be widely applied as a technique to develop recommender systems to support personalized learning environments. Furthermore, because we found that only a few studies have investigated the implementation of this AI technology, researchers will have a great opportunity to explore deep learning to develop more innovative solutions in educational fields.","Fadhla Junus, Sean Brophy",10.18260/1-2--43641,https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--43641,2023 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Proceedings,0,-,maybe,"The paper is focused on academic literature, specifically analyzing papers about deep learning recommender systems.

Computational Architectures for Precision Dairy Nutrition Digital Twins: A Technical Review and Implementation Framework,"Sensor-enabled digital twins (DTs) are reshaping precision dairy nutrition by seamlessly integrating real-time barn telemetry with advanced biophysical simulations in the cloud. Drawing insights from 122 peer-reviewed studies spanning 2010–2025, this systematic review reveals how DT architectures for dairy cattle are conceptualized, validated, and deployed. We introduce a novel five-dimensional classification framework—spanning application domain, modeling paradigms, computational topology, validation protocols, and implementation maturity—to provide a coherent comparative lens across diverse DT implementations. Hybrid edge–cloud architectures emerge as optimal solutions, with lightweight CNN-LSTM models embedded in collar or rumen-bolus microcontrollers achieving over 90% accuracy in recognizing feeding and rumination behaviors. Simultaneously, remote cloud systems harness mechanistic fermentation simulations and multi-objective genetic algorithms to optimize feed composition, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and balance amino acid nutrition. Field-tested prototypes indicate significant agronomic benefits, including 15–20% enhancements in feed conversion efficiency and water use reductions of up to 40%. Nevertheless, critical challenges remain: effectively fusing heterogeneous sensor data amid high barn noise, ensuring millisecond-level synchronization across unreliable rural networks, and rigorously verifying AI-generated nutritional recommendations across varying genotypes, lactation phases, and climates. Overcoming these gaps necessitates integrating explainable AI with biologically grounded digestion models, federated learning protocols for data privacy, and standardized PRISMA-based validation approaches. The distilled implementation roadmap offers actionable guidelines for sensor selection, middleware integration, and model lifecycle management, enabling proactive rather than reactive dairy management—an essential leap toward climate-smart, welfare-oriented, and economically resilient dairy farming.","Shreya Rao, S.

The Evolution and Future of Medical Robotic Diagnostics,"This article provides a systematic review of research in the development of reliable and autonomous robotic systems capable not only of data collection but also of independent data analysis and interpretation. To better understand how to achieve such functions, four core modules are discussed. First, a data acquisition and preprocessing pipeline ensures the quality, consistency, and usability of incoming data by using multiple sensors to collect data and Manhattan distance to conduct correlation analysis. Second, using Probabilistic Neuro-Fuzzy Systems integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) along with Temporal Fusion Net and the model based on the SE-ResNet50 network, they are constructed and optimized for real-time diagnosis models. Third, fault prediction models including a cyber-physical system and a hybrid model forecast failures and maximize accuracy.

Research on product-service systems: topic landscape and future trends,"The paper attempts to address the following research questions (RQs): RQ1: What are the main research topics within PSS research? RQ2: What are future trends for PSS research?,Twenty years of research (1999–2018) on product-service systems (PSS) produced a significant amount of scientific literature on the topic. As the PSS field is relatively new and fragmented across different disciplines, a review of the prior and relevant literature is important in order to provide the necessary framework for understanding current developments and future perspectives. This paper aims to review and organize research contributions regarding PSS. A machine-learning algorithm, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, has been applied to the whole literature corpus on PSS in order to understand its structure.,The adopted approach resulted in the definition of eight distinct and representative topics able to deal adequately with the multidisciplinarity of the PSS. Furthermore, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to summarize the state-of-the-art and limitations in the identified PSS research topics. Based on this critical analysis, major gaps and future research challenges are presented and discussed.,On the basis of the results of the topic landscape, the paper presents some potential research opportunities on PSSs. In particular, challenges, transversal to the eight research topics and related to recent technology trends and digital transformation, have been discussed.","F. Barravecchia, F. Franceschini, L.

Semi-supervised learning models for document classification: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The continuous increase of digital documents on the web creates the need to search for information patterns that allow the categorization of organizational documents to generate knowledge in an institution. An Artificial Intelligence technique for this purpose is text classification, it for its application uses labels (previously categorized documents) with supervised (with labels) or unsupervised (without labels) training models. Both traditional models with their advantages and disadvantages have been joined into semi-supervised models that extract the best qualities of each one, however, the labeling process involves resources and time that try to be optimized to improve classification accuracy.
An analysis of the different semi-supervised models would show us the advantages of their training and the way how the structure of each of them affects the accuracy of their classification. In the present study, a classification structure of the semi-supervised models in the classification of documents is proposed to analyze their qualities and categorization process, through an SLR (Revision of systematic literature) that extracts performance metrics from the identified studies to perform a meta-analysis through forest plots.
To define the search strategy for studies, the PICOC (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outputs, Context) method has been used, it is supported by the research question defines a search string, which has allowed the collection of 228 research, these are filtered with the PRISMA declaration method and the determination of exclusion criteria, in this way 35 researches are selected for the present study.
The analysis of the selected studies identifies a structure for the different semi-supervised learning models, and a scheme of their work process is obtained, it has been used to extract advantages, disadvantages, and performance metrics. Through a meta-analysis with forest diagrams, the classification accuracy performance of the researches in each learning model is evaluated, determining as results that regardless of the characteristics of its process, active learning (0.89) and assembled learning (0.83) present the best performance levels.","Alex Cevallos-Culqui, C.

"Deep Learning for Smart Cities: Innovations, Challenges, and Future Directions","Smart cities are becoming popular nowadays, and since they generate a large amount of data, they can be used for deep learning well. The purpose of this literature is to present a systematic review of applying deep learning to smart cities based on the articles published from the year 2014 to 2024. The review is mainly focused on how deep learning can be incorporated into smart city scenarios in aspects such as transportation, energy, and the environment. Moreover, the paper discusses the limitations and gaps of deep learning in the context of smart cities and the direction for future studies and development. As a result of internationalization, the large majority of the population of the world tends to live in large urban centres, which leads to various issues like traffic and transportation management, power usage, monitoring the surroundings for security, and others.

Deep Learning for LiDAR Point Clouds in Autonomous Driving: A Review,"Recently, the advancement of deep learning (DL) in discriminative feature learning from 3-D LiDAR data has led to rapid development in the field of autonomous driving. However, automated processing uneven, unstructured, noisy, and massive 3-D point clouds are a challenging and tedious task. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing compelling DL architectures applied in LiDAR point clouds, detailing for specific tasks in autonomous driving, such as segmentation, detection, and classification. Although several published research articles focus on specific topics in computer vision for autonomous vehicles, to date, no general survey on DL applied in LiDAR point clouds for autonomous vehicles exists. Thus, the goal of this article is to narrow the gap in this topic.

State-of-the-Art Techniques for Real-Time Monitoring of Urban Flooding: A Review,"In the context of the increasing frequency of urban flooding disasters caused by extreme weather, the accurate and timely identification and monitoring of urban flood risks have become increasingly important. This article begins with a bibliometric analysis of the literature on urban flood monitoring and identification, revealing that since 2017, this area has become a global research hotspot. Subsequently, it presents a systematic review of current mainstream urban flood monitoring technologies, drawing from both traditional and emerging data sources, which are categorized into sensor-based monitoring (including contact and non-contact sensors) and big data-based monitoring (including social media data and surveillance camera data). By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each technology and their different research focuses, this paper points out that current research largely emphasizes more “intelligent” monitoring technologies. However, these technologies still have certain limitations, and traditional sensor monitoring techniques retain significant advantages in practical applications. Therefore, future flood risk monitoring should focus on integrating multiple data sources, fully leveraging the strengths of different data sources to achieve real-time and accurate monitoring of urban flooding.","Jiayi Song, Zhiyu Shao, Ziyi Zhan, Lei Chen",10.3390/w16172476,https://doi.org/10.3390/w16172476,Water,14,2024,maybe,"The paper includes a bibliometric analysis of academic literature on urban flood monitoring, so it does involve academic literature analysis.

Machine learning, with its exceptional capabilities in data analysis and classification prediction, presents a promising approach for improve fuzzing. This paper investigates the latest research results in fuzzing and provides a systematic review of machine learning-based fuzzing techniques. Firstly, by outlining the workflow of fuzzing, it summarizes the optimization of different stages of fuzzing using machine learning. Specifically, it focuses on the application of machine learning in the preprocessing phase, test case generation phase, input selection phase and result analysis phase. Secondly, it mentally focuses on the optimization methods of machine learning in the process of mutation, generation and filtering of test cases and compares and analyzes its technical principles. Furthermore, it analyzes the performance gains brought by applying machine learning techniques to fuzzing, mainly including coverage, vulnerability detection capability, efficiency and effectiveness of test cases. Lastly, it concludes by summarizing the challenges and difficulties in combining machine learning with fuzzing and presents prospects for future trends in this field.","Ao Zhang, Yiying Zhang, Yao Xu, Cong Wang, Siwei Li",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3347652,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3347652,IEEE Access,8,2024,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis, but instead focuses on fuzz testing and machine learning applications in software testing.",no,"The paper does not discuss citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

FAKE REVIEW IDENTIFICATION USING VARIOUS KINDS OF NEURAL NETWORKS – A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"In modern times, the foremost factors influencing the purchase decision of a customer are the reviews of other customers. People make their purchase decisions based on the reviews given by other people, thereby making these reviews a valuable source of information for any companies that wish to sell products online, and customers that wish to buy these products. The reliance of people on these customer reviews in turn may lead to a concern that people may misuse this platform and write fake reviews to untruthfully promote or devalue a certain product or commodity. These are known as Spam Reviews, or fake reviews, wherein people change, manipulate, and poison reviews for their own benefit. This review paper will focus on the latest techniques that have been developed or are in the research phase in order to deal with this research challenge. The methods previously used for this particular application are Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine learning based on supervised learning architecture, etc. These methods are better developed, but have certain limitations.

Artificial Intelligence techniques based on the integration of symbolic logic and deep neural networks: A systematic review of the literature,"The need for neural-symbolic integration becomes apparent as more complex problems are tackled, and they go beyond limited domain tasks such as classification. In this sense, understanding the state of the art of hybrid technologies based on Deep Learning and augmented with logic based systems, is of utmost importance. As a consequence, we seek to understand and represent the current state of these technologies that are highly used in intelligent systems engineering.This work aims to provide a comprehensive view of the solutions available in the literature, within the field of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI), using technologies based on AI techniques that integrate symbolic and non-symbolic logic (in particular artificial neural networks), making them the subject of a systematic literature review (SLR).

A systematic review on deep learning architectures and applications,"The amount of digital data in the universe is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every 2 years, and changing how we live in the world. The information storage capacity and data requirement crossed the zettabytes. With this level of bombardment of data on machine learning techniques, it becomes very difficult to carry out parallel computations. Deep learning is broadening its scope and gaining more popularity in natural language processing, feature extraction and visualization, and almost in every machine learning trend. The purpose of this study is to provide a brief review of deep learning architectures and their working. Research papers and proceedings of conferences from various authentic resources (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Wiley, Nature, and Elsevier) are studied and analyzed. Different architectures and their effectiveness to solve domain specific problems are evaluated. Various limitations and open problems of current architectures are discussed to provide better insights to help researchers and student to resume their research on these issues. One hundred one articles were reviewed for this meta‐analysis of deep learning. From this analysis, it is concluded that advanced deep learning architectures are combinations of few conventional architectures. For example, deep belief network and convolutional neural network are used to build convolutional deep belief network, which has higher capabilities than the parent architectures. These combined architectures are more robust to explore the problem space and thus can be the answer to build a general‐purpose architecture.","A.

Weed mapping using UAV imagery and AI techniques: current trends and challenges,"Despite achieving accuracy rates of over 90% in recognizing weeds in crop fields using images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), challenges remain with embedded systems that perform automatic weed identification in real‐time. The primary objective of this review is to analyze the latest academic research on the application of machine learning/deep learning (DL) techniques for weed recognition, highlight the methodology employed, and identify the challenges encountered. A systematic review was conducted, and the retrieved papers were organized according to the strategy adopted in the proposed method. Then, for each niche, the studies were described and compared in terms of the methodology and the type of issues addressed. This review specifically covers research associated with weed mapping from images captured using UAVs, providing an in‐depth and detailed analysis of them, presenting their advantages and limitations. Regarding classical methodologies, numerous works have focused on the proposition and analysis of features aimed at extracting information related to spectral reflectance, texture, geometry, and other spatial patterns, with the goal of improving the classifier's discrimination capacity. Here, a tendency was observed with respect to non‐visible spectral channels. In contrast, DL methods stand out for their ability to extract multi‐scale features directly from images, leading to promising results in distinguishing between weed species or types. This review outlines the current landscape of UAV imagery‐based weed mapping systems, offering valuable insights for researchers and guiding future efforts toward real‐time weed mapping and the development of intelligent systems for site‐specific herbicide applications. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.","M.

"Agricultural Image Processing: Challenges, Advances, and Future Trends","Agricultural image processing technology plays a critical role in enabling precise disease detection, accurate yield prediction, and various smart agriculture applications. However, its practical implementation faces key challenges, including environmental interference, data scarcity and imbalance datasets, and the difficulty of deploying models on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a systematic review of recent advances in addressing these challenges, with a focus on three core aspects: environmental robustness, data efficiency, and model deployment. The study identifies that attention mechanisms, Transformers, multi-scale feature fusion, and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness under complex conditions. Self-supervised learning, transfer learning, GAN-based data augmentation, SMOTE improvements, and Focal loss optimization effectively alleviate data limitations. Furthermore, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation facilitate efficient deployment. Future research should emphasize multi-modal fusion, causal reasoning, edge–cloud collaboration, and dedicated hardware acceleration.

Machine Learning in Sustainable Agriculture: Systematic Review and Research Perspectives,"Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized resource management in agriculture by analyzing vast amounts of data and creating precise predictive models. Precision agriculture improves agricultural productivity and profitability while reducing costs and environmental impact. However, ML implementation faces challenges such as managing large volumes of data and adequate infrastructure. Despite significant advances in ML applications in sustainable agriculture, there is still a lack of deep and systematic understanding in several areas. Challenges include integrating data sources and adapting models to local conditions. This research aims to identify research trends and key players associated with ML use in sustainable agriculture. A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA methodology by a bibliometric analysis to capture relevant studies from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The study analyzed the ML literature in sustainable agriculture between 2007 and 2025, identifying 124 articles that meet the criteria for certainty assessment. The findings show a quadratic polynomial growth in the publication of articles on ML in sustainable agriculture, with a notable increase of up to 91% per year. The most productive years were 2024, 2022, and 2023, demonstrating a growing interest in the field. The study highlights the importance of integrating data from multiple sources for improved decision making, soil health monitoring, and understanding the interaction between climate, topography, and soil properties with agricultural land use and crop patterns. Furthermore, ML in sustainable agriculture has evolved from understanding weather data to integrating advanced technologies like the Internet of Things, remote sensing, and smart farming. Finally, the research agenda highlights the need for the deepening and expansion of predominant concepts, such as deep learning and smart farming, to develop more detailed and specialized studies and explore new applications to maximize the benefits of ML in agricultural sustainability.","J.

Current Status and Challenges in Usability Evaluation Research on Human–Machine Interaction in Intelligent Vehicles: A Systematic Review,"Usability evaluation is a crucial stage in optimizing human–machine interaction design for intelligent vehicles. The academic community has accumulated substantial research findings on this topic. However, the global landscape, core focus areas, and potential challenges of these findings remain unclear and require systematic review and analysis. This is essential for understanding progress in the field and clarifying future research and technological development directions. To address this research need, we followed the PRISMA guidelines and conducted a systematic review of 158 applied research cases in the field of usability evaluation for intelligent vehicle human–machine interaction. We focused on analyzing the automation levels, task scenarios, and interaction modalities examined in these cases. Based on this analysis, we examined the current development status and potential challenges and identified future development recommendations for this field. Our research reveals that current usability evaluation studies of intelligent vehicle human–machine interaction exhibit a contradictory pattern of “coexisting development and limitations.” On the one hand, the research scope and depth continue to expand with technological advances. On the other hand, related research topics show obvious lag, with particularly insufficient research on non-driving tasks and multimodal interaction topics. The potential challenges arising from this research status seriously constrain industry development and require practitioners to actively address them. In this regard, our research findings provide a valuable reference for practitioners in understanding the current research progress and planning future development directions.","Datao Zhou, Xiaofang Yuan, Yidi Sun, Yu Wu",10.3390/app15179384,https://doi.org/10.3390/app15179384,Applied Sciences,0,2025,maybe,"The paper is a systematic review of academic literature, specifically analyzing 158 research cases.

AI in Turnover Risk Assessment: Early Warning Algorithms and Employee Retention Strategies,"This paper reviews artificial intelligence approaches to predicting the risks of employee turnover and managing strategies designed to retain them. The purpose of the current study is to carry out a systematic review and practical assessment of existing algorithms used as early warnings for personnel turnover in corporate environments and to recommend ways through which the derived models could be incorporated into HR management processes. The relevance of this work is determined by organizations’ enormous costs associated with replacing specialists, the rapid growth of the HR analytics market, and the need to shift from a reactive turnover management model to a proactive talent-retention system. The novelty of the research lies in the comprehensive comparison of classical statistical methods (logistic regression, CoxRF) and modern machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, LSTM-RNN, Bidirectional-TCN, graph neural networks) on both proprietary and open datasets, as well as in the incorporation of interpretability criteria (SHAP, LIME), organizational and ethical barriers, MLOps requirements, and EU regulatory standards into the architecture of predictive HR systems. The findings demonstrate that basic statistical models provide a rapid start and clear interpretability on small samples; however, as data volumes grow, gradient boosting emerges as the “gold standard,” and recurrent and convolutional networks become preferable for analyzing temporal communications. Graph neural networks improve flight-risk detection quality by accounting for social connections, while interpretability tools enable the translation of a score into a concrete retention plan. The key takeaway is the need for an integrated approach: starting from detailed data prep and cleanup, building a cross-functional team, setting up an MLOps loop, designing solutions ethically, training end-users, and monitoring success metrics regularly.

IoT architectural concerns: a systematic review,"There is increasing interest in studying and applying Internet of Things (IoT) within the overall context of digital-physical ecosystems. Most recently, much has been published on the benefits and applications of IoT. The main question is: what are the key IoT architectural concerns, which must be addressed to effectively develop and implement an IoT architecture? There is a need to systematically review and synthesize the literature on IoT architectural challenges or concerns. Using the SLR approach and applying customised search criteria derived from the research question, 22 relevant studies were identified and reviewed in this paper. The data from these papers were extracted to identify the IoT architectural challenges and relevant solutions. These results were organised into to 9 major challenge and 7 solution categories. The results of this research will serve as a resource for practitioners and researchers for the effective adoption, and setting future research priorities and directions in this emerging area of IoT architecture.","A.

Distributed Denial of Services: Detection and Prevention,"Distributed Denial of Service is one of the most
prominent and dangerous types of attacks dis-
rupting critical online services, suffering finan- cial
losses, and affecting organizational oper- ations.
The exploitation of vulnerabilities is enough to
overwhelm the targeted websites with malicious
traffic, making them inaccessible to legitimate
users. Such sophistication in attack patterns
coupled with explosive growth in con- nected
devices has challenged the traditional approaches of
detection, being bare minimum signature-based or
basic anomaly detection and likely to pose difficulties
in coping with emerging threats, thus prone to high
false positives.
This paper presents a systematic review of ten
works from very recent literature on ML and DL
applications in DDoS detection and mit- igation.
The techniques thus are supervised, unsupervised,
and hybrids applied to datasets such as NSL-KDD,
CICIDS2017. ML and DL
techniques do appear promising for increas- ing
accuracy in detection and adaptability, but then
challenges persist-in scalability, efficiency or speed of
computation, and quality of datasets. It would
challenge the future of research: more light on real-
time models, more diversified and all-inclusive
datasets, and edge and federated computing towards
better accelerated detection. These would
significantly contribute to the ad- vancement of
scalable effective solutions that counter complex
DDoS threats in today’s net- work environments.

Application Review of Network Attack Detection Based on Deep Learning,"With the rapid development of the Internet, network attacks (NA) have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Traditional detection methods relying on rules systems and statistical analysis now face significant challenges, including strong dependency on feature engineering and limited generalization ability. The effectiveness of detection systems is not only limited, but the difficulty of addressing new threats is also increased. Deep learning has been recognized as a novel solution for NA detection due to its powerful nonlinear feature extraction capabilities and end-to-end learning paradigm. A concise overview of deep learning fundamentals is first provided. Subsequently, the paper proceeds with a systematic review of prevailing deep learning approaches for NA detection, followed by an analysis of their current limitations and challenges in NA. Finally, promising future research directions are proposed to address the aforementioned limitations and challenges.","Yixuan Liu, Jiaohang Yu",10.62051/9dg86559,https://doi.org/10.62051/9dg86559,Transactions on Computer Science and Intelligent Systems Research,0,2025,no,"The paper does not focus on academic literature analysis, but instead focuses on network attack detection using deep learning.",no,There is no mention of citation analysis or bibliometric methods in the paper.

Educational Data Mining: A Systematic Review on the Applications of Classical Methods and Deep Learning Until 2022,"Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a research field that focuses on extracting valuable insights and knowledge from data in the education sector. EDM exploits Data Mining (DM) techniques such as Clustering, Regression to analyze data and make predictions that help answer questions in education. Meanwhile, Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks to solve complex problems related to natural language processing and computer vision. DL is highly effective at processing textual and digital data such as images, audio, and video. DL can be applied to build automatic grading, attendance, monitoring systems, or intelligent learning systems in education. However, the applicability of DL in education still needs to be solved due to strict education regulations and policies with the many challenges involved in collecting and utilizing data processes. Additionally, education is subject to many ethical and legal controversies. This survey aims to clarify the concepts and issues related to EDM, such as technology, users, and data. It also explores the technologies and applications of DL in the educational environment, including the barriers and difficulties encountered when applying these technologies.

Deep learning for surgical instrument recognition and segmentation in robotic-assisted surgeries: a systematic review,"Abstract Applying deep learning (DL) for annotating surgical instruments in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) represents a significant advancement in surgical technology. This systematic review examines 48 studies that utilize advanced DL methods and architectures. These sophisticated DL models have shown notable improvements in the precision and efficiency of detecting and segmenting surgical tools. The enhanced capabilities of these models support various clinical applications, including real-time intraoperative guidance, comprehensive postoperative evaluations, and objective assessments of surgical skills. By accurately identifying and segmenting surgical instruments in video data, DL models provide detailed feedback to surgeons, thereby improving surgical outcomes and reducing complication risks. Furthermore, the application of DL in surgical education is transformative. The review underscores the significant impact of DL on improving the accuracy of skill assessments and the overall quality of surgical training programs. However, implementing DL in surgical tool detection and segmentation faces challenges, such as the need for large, accurately annotated datasets to train these models effectively. The manual annotation process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, posing a significant bottleneck. Future research should focus on automating the detection and segmentation process and enhancing the robustness of DL models against environmental variations. Expanding the application of DL models across various surgical specialties will be essential to fully realize this technology’s potential. Integrating DL with other emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), also offers promising opportunities to further enhance the precision and efficacy of surgical procedures.","F.

Deep Learning Applications in Drug-Target Interaction Prediction: A Systematic Review,": This systematic review examines the evolving landscape of deep learning applications in drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction, a critical component in modern drug discovery and development. Through comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed literature from 2018-2023, we evaluate the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on pharmaceutical research, focusing on architectural innovations, methodological advances, and performance metrics. The study analyzes various deep learning approaches, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and graph neural networks (GNNs), assessing their relative effectiveness in DTI prediction tasks. Our findings indicate that deep learning methods consistently outperform traditional computational approaches, demonstrating average accuracy improvements of 23-35% across diverse datasets. Particularly noteworthy is the success of hybrid architectures in handling complex molecular structures and protein sequences, achieving prediction accuracies exceeding 90% in standardized benchmarks. The review identifies significant advances in three key areas: molecular representation learning, binding affinity prediction, and interaction site identification. However, current challenges persist, including limited availability of high-quality experimental data, computational resource requirements, and model interpretability issues. We also address emerging trends in few-shot learning and transfer learning applications, which show promise in addressing data scarcity challenges.

Cross-Modal Retrieval: A Systematic Review of Methods and Future Directions,"With the exponential surge in diverse multi-modal data, traditional uni-modal retrieval methods struggle to meet the needs of users demanding access to data from various modalities. To address this, cross-modal retrieval has emerged, enabling interaction across modalities, facilitating semantic matching, and leveraging complementarity and consistency between different modal data. Although prior literature undertook a review of the cross-modal retrieval field, it exhibits numerous deficiencies pertaining to timeliness, taxonomy, and comprehensiveness. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of cross-modal retrieval's evolution, spanning from shallow statistical analysis techniques to vision-language pre-training models. Commencing with a comprehensive taxonomy grounded in machine learning paradigms, mechanisms, and models, the paper then delves deeply into the principles and architectures underpinning existing cross-modal retrieval methods. Furthermore, it offers an overview of widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances. Lastly, the paper probes the prospects and challenges that confront contemporary cross-modal retrieval, while engaging in a discourse on potential directions for further progress in the field.

"Advancements in Recommender Systems: A Comprehensive Analysis Based on Data, Algorithms, and Evaluation","Using 286 research papers collected from Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, arXiv, and Google Scholar databases, a systematic review methodology was adopted to review and summarize the current challenges and potential future developments in data, algorithms, and evaluation aspects of RSs. It was found that RSs involve five major research topics, namely algorithmic improvement, domain applications, user behavior&cognition, data processing&modeling, and social impact&ethics. Collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendation techniques are mainstream. The performance of RSs is jointly limited by four types of eight data issues, two types of twelve algorithmic issues, and two evaluation issues.

A review of research on driving distraction based on bibliometrics and co-occurrence: Focus on driving distraction recognition methods.,"INTRODUCTION
The existing selection of driving distraction recognition methods is based on a specific research perspective and does not provide comprehensive information on the entire field of view.
METHOD
We conducted a systematic review of previous studies, aiming to come up with appropriate research methods to identify the driver's distraction state. First, this article selects four sets of search keywords related to driving distraction discrimination from five databases (Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, IEEE, and TRID) and identifies 1,620 peer-reviewed documents from 2000 to 2020; these 1,620 documents underwent bibliographic analysis and co-occurrence network analysis. The co-occurrence coupling relationship is analyzed from the aspects of time, country, publication, author and keywords. Second, 37 papers published were screened, and the driving distraction recognition methods proposed by these 37 papers were summarized and analyzed.
RESULTS
The results show that this field has been prevalent since 2013; countries such as the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia, China, and Canada are in the forefront of research in this field, and the cooperation between related countries is relatively close. The cooperation between authors is characterized by aggregation, and the mobile phone as the main keyword is almost connected to other keyword nodes; the recognition model of deep learning algorithm based on video surveillance data sources has become the mainstream hot spot distraction recognition method. The recognition model of machine learning algorithm based on vehicle dynamics data, driver physiology, and eye movement data sources has specific advantages and disadvantages.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The results can help people to understand the current situation of driving distraction comprehensively and systematically, provide better theoretical support for researchers to choose the subsequent driving distraction recognition model, and provide research direction for driving distraction recognition in the future.

Combinatorial Analysis of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Video Captioning Studies: A Systematic Literature Review,"Recent improvements formulated in the area of video captioning have brought rapid revolutions in its methods and the performance of its models. Machine learning and deep learning techniques are both employed in this regard. However, there is a lack of tracing the latest studies and their remarkable results. Although several studies have been proposed employing the ML and DL algorithms in different other areas, there is no systematic review utilizing the video captioning task. This study aims to examine, evaluate, and synthesize the primary studies into a thorough Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides a general overview of the methods used for video captioning. We performed the SLR to determine the research problems under which machine learning models were preferred over the deep learning models and vice versa. We collected a total of 1,656 studies retrieved from four electronic databases; Scopus, WoS, IEEE Xplore, and ACM, based on our search string from which 162 published studies passed the selection criteria related to one primary and two secondary research questions after a systematic process. Moreover, insufficient data collection and inefficient comparison of results are common issues identified during the review process. We conclude that the 2D/3D CNN for video feature extraction and LSTM for caption generation, METEOR and BLEU performance evaluation tools, and MSVD dataset are most frequently employed for video captioning. Our study is the pioneer in comparing the implementation of ML and DL algorithms employing the video captioning area. Thus, our study will accelerate the critical assessment of the state-of-the-art in other research fields of video analysis and human-computer interaction.","Tanzila Kehkashan, A. Alsaeedi, Wael M. S.

Advances in Neuroimaging and Deep Learning for Emotion Detection: A Systematic Review of Cognitive Neuroscience and Algorithmic Innovations,"Background/Objectives: The following systematic review integrates neuroimaging techniques with deep learning approaches concerning emotion detection. It, therefore, aims to merge cognitive neuroscience insights with advanced algorithmic methods in pursuit of an enhanced understanding and applications of emotion recognition. Methods: The study was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, involving a rigorous selection process that resulted in the inclusion of 64 empirical studies that explore neuroimaging modalities such as fMRI, EEG, and MEG, discussing their capabilities and limitations in emotion recognition. It further evaluates deep learning architectures, including neural networks, CNNs, and GANs, in terms of their roles in classifying emotions from various domains: human-computer interaction, mental health, marketing, and more. Ethical and practical challenges in implementing these systems are also analyzed. Results: The review identifies fMRI as a powerful but resource-intensive modality, while EEG and MEG are more accessible with high temporal resolution but limited by spatial accuracy. Deep learning models, especially CNNs and GANs, have performed well in classifying emotions, though they do not always require large and diverse datasets. Combining neuroimaging data with behavioral and cognitive features improves classification performance. However, ethical challenges, such as data privacy and bias, remain significant concerns. Conclusions: The study has emphasized the efficiencies of neuroimaging and deep learning in emotion detection, while various ethical and technical challenges were also highlighted. Future research should integrate behavioral and cognitive neuroscience advances, establish ethical guidelines, and explore innovative methods to enhance system reliability and applicability.","C.

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF INTELLIGENT SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING USING HUMAN-AI INTERACTION IN ENTERPRISE PLATFORMS,"This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive and methodologically rigorous synthesis of scholarly work on Intelligent Support Systems (ISS), focusing on their design architectures, strategic applications, ethical governance, and human-AI interaction (HAII) frameworks within organizational contexts. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines, the review evaluates 124 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2013 and 2023, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and academic rigor in article selection and synthesis. The findings reveal a significant shift in ISS development from traditional rule-based systems toward hybrid and neural network-driven architectures, which offer improved predictive capabilities, flexibility, and real-time responsiveness. However, this transition introduces new challenges, particularly in terms of model interpretability, trust calibration, and dynamic system transparency. The review also identifies a growing trend in the adoption of AI-augmented strategic decision-making tools, such as decision-tree learning and reinforcement learning, which support portfolio management, resource optimization, and scenario-based planning. Despite these advancements, there is a notable deficiency in longitudinal performance evaluation, with very few studies tracking system impact or user trust over extended periods. While regulatory and governance frameworks such as GDPR, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC standards are frequently referenced, only a limited number of studies report concrete implementation in live systems. The study concludes that future research must adopt a multidisciplinary lens, incorporating ethical AI principles, culturally aware design, long-term performance tracking, and user-centric evaluation metrics to ensure that ISS technologies evolve in a responsible, equitable, and sustainable manner. This review contributes to bridging the gap between advanced computational capabilities and the ethical, strategic, and social imperatives that define effective decision support in contemporary enterprises.","Md Arifur Rahman, Md Shakawat Hossain, Abdul Awal Mintoo, Siful Islam",10.63125/a5yh1293,https://doi.org/10.63125/a5yh1293,American Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Solutions,0,2025,yes,"The paper is a systematic literature review of academic papers (124 peer-reviewed journal articles), so it clearly meets this criterion.",maybe,"While the paper follows PRISMA guidelines for systematic review, it doesn't explicitly mention citation analysis or bibliometric methods for identifying core papers.",no,"The paper discusses advanced computational capabilities and AI systems, but not specifically for literature analysis.

By Jun Zhang, Yong Zhang, Chang Liu, Tom Covey, Julia Nielsen, Shu Li, Harold Weller, Wilson Shou High-throughput analysis of compound dissolved in DMSO and arrayed in multiwell plates for quality control (QC) purposes has widespread utility in drug discovery, ranging from the QC of assay-ready plates dispatched by compound management, to compound integrity check in the screening collection, to reaction monitoring of chemical syntheses in microtiter plates. Due to the large number of samples (thousands per batch) involved, these workflows can put a significant burden on the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform typically used. To achieve the required speed of seconds per sample, several chromatography-free MS approaches have previously been used with mixed results. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of acoustic ejection-mass spectrometry (AE-MS) in full-scan mode for high-throughput compound QC in miniaturized formats, featuring direct, contactless liquid sampling, minimal sample consumption, and ultrafast analytical speed. The sample consumption and analysis time by AE-MS represent, respectively, a 1000-fold and 30-fold reduction compared with LC-MS. In qualitative QC, AE-MS generated comparable results to conventional LC-MS in identifying the presence and absence of expected compounds. AE-MS also demonstrated its utility in relative quantifications of the same compound in serial dilution plates, or substrate in chemical synthesis. To facilitate the processing of a large amount of data generated by AE-MS, we have developed a data processing platform using commercially available tools. The platform demonstrated fast and straightforward data extraction, reviewing, and reporting, thus eliminating the need for the development of custom data processing tools. The overall AE-MS workflow has effectively eliminated the analytical bottleneck in the high-throughput compound QC work stream.

However, culturing high-quality cells with a high degree of reproducibility relies heavily on expert skills and tacit knowledge, and it is not straightforward to scale the production process due to the education bottleneck. Although many automated culture systems have been developed and a few have succeeded in mass production environments, very few robots are permissive of frequent protocol changes, which are often required in basic research environments. LabDroid is a general-purpose humanoid robot with two arms that performs experiments using the same tools as humans. Combining our newly developed AI software with LabDroid, we developed a variable scheduling system that continuously produces subcultures of cell lines without human intervention. The system periodically observes the cells on plates with a microscope, predicts the cell growth curve by processing cell images, and decides the best times for passage. We have succeeded in developing a system that maintains the cultures of two HEK293A cell plates with no human intervention for 192 h. By Anh Tong, Quang Long Pham, Paul Abatemarco, Austin Mathew, Dhruv Gupta, Siddharth Iyer, Roman Voronov Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has become mainstream for precise and repeatable high-throughput fabrication of complex cell cultures and tissue constructs in drug testing and regenerative medicine, food products, dental and medical implants, biosensors, and so forth. Due to this tremendous growth in demand, an overwhelming amount of hardware manufacturers have recently flooded the market with different types of low-cost bioprinter models-a price segment that is most affordable to typical-sized laboratories. These machines range in sophistication, type of the underlying printing technology, and possible add-ons/features, which makes the selection process rather daunting (especially for a nonexpert customer). Yet, the review articles available in the literature mostly focus on the technical aspects of the printer technologies under development, as opposed to explaining the differences in what is already on the market. In contrast, this paper provides a snapshot of the fast-evolving low-cost bioprinter niche, as well as reputation profiles (relevant to delivery time, part quality, adherence to specifications, warranty, maintenance, etc.) of the companies selling these machines. Specifically, models spanning three dominant technologies-microextrusion, droplet-based/inkjet, and light-based/crosslinking-are reviewed. Additionally, representative examples of high-end competitors (including up-and-coming microfluidics-based bioprinters) are discussed to highlight their major differences and advantages relative to the low-cost models. Finally, forecasts are made based on the trends observed during this survey, as to the anticipated trickling down of the high-end technologies to the low-cost printers.

Image Analysis Based on Heterogeneous Architectures for Precision Agriculture: A Systematic Literature Review,"Precision agriculture (AP) is a management strategy that uses ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) to obtain information from different sources in order to support decision-making, considering environmental and economic aspects to optimize the Farmer's tasks and provide quality products to the costumer. The application of AP in agriculture can reduce time spent in manual activities, avoid the indiscriminate use of chemicals, increase production costs, soil deterioration and environmental pollution. Nowadays, AP is a booming area that, taking advantage of technological advances, in computer vision, heterogeneous architectures (Multicore, GPU, FGPA) and artificial intelligence techniques (Machine learning, Deep learning), has allowed to systematize a variety of agricultural activities, such as disease detection, plant counting, and identification of weed, pests and insects in different crops. This paper presents a systematic review of literature (SRL) of image analysis and processing techniques applied in precision agriculture using heterogeneous technologies. Therefore, 32 scientific articles of the last five years from four relevant bibliographic databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink) were analyzed and synthesized. The selected publications answer to four research questions proposed in this study. From the obtained results, great opportunities for image analysis (segmentation), machine learning and the use of graphic accelerators (GPU) were identified, which stand out as promising techniques and tools for the development of efficient and precise automatic systems, with the perspective to its application in real time for many agricultural tasks.","Marco Pusdá-Chulde, Fausto A.

Multi-Task Deep Recommender Systems: A Survey,"Multi-task learning (MTL) aims at learning related tasks in a unified model to achieve mutual improvement among tasks considering their shared knowledge. It is an important topic in recommendation due to the demand for multi-task prediction considering performance and efficiency. Although MTL has been well studied and developed, there is still a lack of systematic review in the recommendation community. To fill the gap, we provide a comprehensive review of existing multi-task deep recommender systems (MTDRS) in this survey. To be specific, the problem definition of MTDRS is first given, and it is compared with other related areas. Next, the development of MTDRS is depicted and the taxonomy is introduced from the task relation and methodology aspects. Specifically, the task relation is categorized into parallel, cascaded, and auxiliary with main, while the methodology is grouped into parameter sharing, optimization, and training mechanism. The survey concludes by summarizing the application and public datasets of MTDRS and highlighting the challenges and future directions of the field.","Yuhao Wang, Ha T. Lam, Y.

From Conventional Methods to Large Language Models: A Systematic Review of Techniques in Mobile App Review Analysis,"Aim/Purpose: This paper focuses on app review analysis techniques, driven by the rapid advancement of the mobile app market and NLP techniques in optimizing mobile app user experiences. Background: Owing to technological advancements, app review analysis has rapidly evolved. This study examines both conventional and emerging techniques, including current advancements such as large language models (LLMs) in app review analysis. It provides an overview of the various methods used across different categories of app review analysis, comparing effective strategies for identifying user concerns and enhancing app functionality. Methodology: A systematic review was utilized based on two major standard guidelines, PRISMA and Kitchenham’s guidelines, for the period of 2014 to 2024. After defining the review protocol, papers were identified through keyword-based searches on six major online databases: Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, and Springer. Following screening and excluding papers based on defined quality criteria, 53 papers were considered for this study. The use of PRISMA ensures a transparent and reproducible review process, while Kitchenham’s guidelines provide a structured and rigorous approach for evaluating and synthesizing the literature. Contribution: This review study aims to evaluate the current state of knowledge on app review analysis techniques to improve mobile app user experiences. This study categorized the existing state-of-the-art papers into eight different categories, such as sentiment analysis, review classification, summarization, and prioritization, and examined challenges related to app review analysis. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the potential of LLMs for optimizing and automating app review analysis and provides future directions to address gaps in user-centric app development. Findings: Among the eight main categories defined in app review analysis, sentiment analysis is the most prevalent, followed by review classification and information extraction. Most studies use a combination of these categories to achieve a comprehensive goal. Prioritization techniques such as risk matrices, thumbs-up count-based approach, and anomaly detection are widely used to identify emerging issues. Extracting meaningful information and evaluating the proposed approach are the most common challenges identified. Novel LLMs, like Chat-GPT, significantly enhance review analysis by automating the process, improving feature extraction, and enabling context-aware review classification. Recommendations for Practitioners: The combination of conventional approaches and novel LLM-based methods can enhance both the efficiency and accuracy in identifying and addressing critical issues raised through mobile app user reviews. It effectively prioritizes user concerns by leveraging the strengths of both traditional preprocessing techniques and advanced LLMs. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers are encouraged to explore the integration of emerging technologies like LLMs to enhance the of app review analysis, particularly in feature-specific sentiment analysis. Impact on Society: The results of this study contribute to enhancing the mobile app user experience through effective app review analysis, which improves user satisfaction and supports user-centered app development. This ultimately leads to a better mobile app ecosystem, benefiting both users and developers. Future Research: In the future, this research can be extended in multiple directions. Researchers can address the existing research gaps that LLMs have yet to address, particularly in prioritizing user concerns. Additionally, there is potential for further research on tool implementations focusing on identifying persistent issues through time series analysis by considering the app version and date of the app reviews. Moreover, there is a need to develop comprehensive frameworks that are more generalizable across different apps and categories, with a focus on identifying user concerns related to specific features.","Nimasha Arambepola, Waruni Lalendra Wimalasena, Lankeshwara Munasinghe",10.28945/5491,https://doi.org/10.28945/5491,"Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management",1,2025,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis, but rather on analyzing mobile app reviews.

Towards more precise automatic analysis: a systematic review of deep learning-based multi-organ segmentation,"Abstract Accurate segmentation of multiple organs in the head, neck, chest, and abdomen from medical images is an essential step in computer-aided diagnosis, surgical navigation, and radiation therapy. In the past few years, with a data-driven feature extraction approach and end-to-end training, automatic deep learning-based multi-organ segmentation methods have far outperformed traditional methods and become a new research topic. This review systematically summarizes the latest research in this field. We searched Google Scholar for papers published from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2023, using keywords “multi-organ segmentation” and “deep learning”, resulting in 327 papers. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for paper selection, and 195 studies were deemed to be within the scope of this review. We summarized the two main aspects involved in multi-organ segmentation: datasets and methods. Regarding datasets, we provided an overview of existing public datasets and conducted an in-depth analysis. Concerning methods, we categorized existing approaches into three major classes: fully supervised, weakly supervised and semi-supervised, based on whether they require complete label information.

Extractive text summarization system to aid data extraction from full text in systematic review development,"OBJECTIVES
Extracting data from publication reports is a standard process in systematic review (SR) development. However, the data extraction process still relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process.
METHODS
We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were evaluated in finding common clinical SR data elements such as sample size, group size, and PICO values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review's study characteristics tables.
RESULTS
At the sentence level, the computer-generated summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 91.2% vs. 83.8%, p<0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences (precision 59% vs. 39%, p<0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7% F-measure.
CONCLUSION
Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an extractive summarization system.

Identity Card Presentation Attack Detection: A Systematic Review,"Remote identity verification is essential for modern digital security; however, it remains highly vulnerable to sophisticated Presentation Attacks (PAs) that utilise forged or manipulated identity documents. Although Deep Learning (DL) has driven advances in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), the field is fundamentally limited by a lack of data and the poor generalisation of models across various document types and new attack methods. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) conducted in accordance with the PRISMA methodology, aiming to analyse and synthesise the current state of AI-based PAD for identity documents from 2020 to 2025 comprehensively. Our analysis reveals a significant methodological evolution: a transition from standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to specialised forensic micro-artefact analysis, and more recently, the adoption of large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), marking a substantial shift in the field. We identify a central paradox that hinders progress: a critical""Reality Gap""exists between models validated on extensive, private datasets and those assessed using limited public datasets, which typically consist of mock-ups or synthetic data. This gap limits the reproducibility of research results. Additionally, we highlight a""Synthetic Utility Gap,""where synthetic data generation the primary academic response to data scarcity often fails to predict forensic utility. This can lead to model overfitting to generation artefacts instead of the actual attack. This review consolidates our findings, identifies critical research gaps, and provides a definitive reference framework that outlines a prescriptive roadmap for future research aimed at developing secure, robust, and globally generalizable PAD systems.","Esteban M.

Future libraries' blockchain opportunities and challenges: a systematic literature review and research agenda,"Purpose
The purpose of this study is to look into the concept of blockchain technology which stores data in a distributed, tamper-resistant setting and how this technology may affect the future library and information (LI) centers’ operations and policy. It explores the potential benefits and limitations of this technology, for LI centers are the core objectives of this paper.
Design/methodology/approach
A systematic review of both academic and practitioner literature was conducted. It followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (2020) standards.
Findings
The review shows that the decentralized nature of blockchain will transform the work in libraries and improve the inter-communication among communities. It can provide better privacy of user data thus increasing collaboration. However, there might be technological, financial, legal and social challenges that may act as hurdles to the realization of these goals in the true sense. The overall result shows that by keeping data updated, libraries can evaluate blockchain opportunities and make the best use of this technology.
Practical implications
Given the huge investments by industry, academic research that explores potential ramifications and supports libraries is required. The adoption of blockchain was investigated in this study from a variety of perspectives for LI center’s while also providing directions for future research.
Originality/value
It is evident that globally there is progress in blockchain technology development in terms of research and adoption in many industries, but the intention to adopt blockchain by libraries is still a fantasy.

Mapping Artificial Intelligence in Education Research: a Network‐based Keyword Analysis,"In this study, we review 1830 research articles on artificial intelligence in education (AIED), with the aim of providing a holistic picture of the knowledge evolution in this interdisciplinary research field from 2010 to 2019. A novel three-step approach in the analysis of the keyword co-occurrence networks (KCN) is proposed to identify the knowledge structure, knowledge clusters and trending keywords within AIED over time. The results reveal considerable research diversity in the AIED field, centering around two sustained themes: intelligent tutoring systems (2010-19) and massive open online courses (since 2014). The focal educational concerns reflected in AIED research are: (1) online learning; (2) game-based learning; (3) collaborative learning; (4) assessment; (5) affect; (6) engagement; and (7) learning design. The highly connected keywords relevant to analytic techniques within this field include natural language processing, educational data mining, learning analytics and machine learning. Neural network, deep learning, eye tracking, and personalized learning are trending keywords in this field as they have emerged with key structural roles in the latest two-year period analyzed. This is the first article providing a systematic review of a large body of literature on artificial intelligence in education, and in it we uncover the underlying patterns of knowledge connectivity within the field, as well as provide insight into its future development.

A Systematic Review on Literature-based Discovery,"The vast nature of scientific publications brings out the importance of Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) research that is highly beneficial to accelerate knowledge acquisition and the research development process. LBD is a knowledge discovery workflow that automatically detects significant, implicit knowledge associations hidden in fragmented knowledge areas by analysing existing scientific literature. Therefore, the LBD output not only assists in formulating scientifically sensible, novel research hypotheses but also encourages the development of cross-disciplinary research. In this systematic review, we provide an in-depth analysis of the computational techniques used in the LBD process using a novel, up-to-date, and detailed classification. Moreover, we also summarise the key milestones of the discipline through a timeline of topics. To provide a general overview of the discipline, the review outlines LBD validation checks, major LBD tools, application areas, domains, and generalisability of LBD methodologies. We also outline the insights gathered through our statistical analysis that capture the trends in LBD literature.

Based on the reviewed findings, we introduce taxonomies driven by the following five phases: initiation (architecture and data acquisition techniques), design (design types and techniques), development (implementation methods and algorithms), evaluation (metrics and measurement techniques) and application (domains of applications). A layered framework of recommender systems containing market strategy, data, recommender core, interaction, security and evaluation is proposed.

A Survey of Source Code Search: A 3-Dimensional Perspective,"(Source) code search is widely concerned by software engineering researchers because it can improve the productivity and quality of software development. Given a functionality requirement usually described in a natural language sentence, a code search system can retrieve code snippets that satisfy the requirement from a large-scale code corpus, e.g., GitHub. To realize effective and efficient code search, many techniques have been proposed successively. These techniques improve code search performance mainly by optimizing three core components, including query understanding component, code understanding component, and query-code matching component. In this article, we provide a 3-dimensional perspective survey for code search. Specifically, we categorize existing code search studies into query-end optimization techniques, code-end optimization techniques, and match-end optimization techniques according to the specific components they optimize. These optimization techniques are proposed to enhance the performance of specific components, and thus the overall performance of code search. Considering that each end can be optimized independently and contributes to the code search performance, we treat each end as a dimension. Therefore, this survey is 3-dimensional in nature, and it provides a comprehensive summary of each dimension in detail. To understand the research trends of the three dimensions in existing code search studies, we systematically review 68 relevant literatures. Different from existing code search surveys that only focus on the query end or code end or introduce various aspects shallowly (including codebase, evaluation metrics, modeling technique, etc.), our survey provides a more nuanced analysis and review of the evolution and development of the underlying techniques used in the three ends. Based on a systematic review and summary of existing work, we outline several open challenges and opportunities at the three ends that remain to be addressed in future work.","Weisong Sun, Chunrong Fang, Yifei Ge, Yuling Hu, Yuchen Chen, Quanjun Zhang, Xiuting Ge, Yang Liu, Zhenyu Chen",10.48550/arXiv.2311.07107,https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.07107,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,15,2023,no,"The paper focuses on code search rather than academic literature search.

Searching through the COVID-19 research literature to gain actionable clinical insight is a formidable task, even for experts. The usefulness of this corpus in terms of improving patient care is tied to the ability to see the big picture that emerges when the studies are seen in conjunction rather than in isolation. When the answer to a search query requires linking together multiple pieces of information across documents, simple keyword searches are insufficient. To answer such complex information needs, an innovative AI technology called a knowledge graph (KG) could prove to be effective. abstract, and tagging information. The superiority of Google Scholar over PubMed with respect to the ability to retrieve relevant articles using a quick search has been studied before. The advantages of PubMed over Google Scholar, which mainly stem from PubMed using human curation, are irrelevant for this review, because the sources identified by Google Scholar are perused by us before inclusion in the results. It would be unacceptable to use Google Scholar for a systematic review because the process must be repeatable, and human judgement used for quality evaluation is subjective (and thus not repeatable). However, for an exploratory review, this does not pose a problem, and using Google Scholar allows access to a larger number of sources (sometimes referred to as ‘grey literature’). An up-to-date comparison of these different search approaches from the perspective of a librarian can be found elsewhere. especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile.

Cost-effectiveness of Microsoft Academic Graph with machine learning for automated study identification in a living map of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) research.,"Background
Identifying new, eligible studies for integration into living systematic reviews and maps usually relies on conventional Boolean updating searches of multiple databases and manual processing of the updated results. Automated searches of one, comprehensive, continuously updated source, with adjunctive machine learning, could enable more efficient searching, selection and prioritisation workflows for updating (living) reviews and maps, though research is needed to establish this. Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) is a potentially comprehensive single source which also contains metadata that can be used in machine learning to help efficiently identify eligible studies. This study sought to establish whether: (a) MAG was a sufficiently sensitive single source to maintain our living map of COVID-19 research; and (b) eligible records could be identified with an acceptably high level of specificity.
Methods
We conducted an eight-arm cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the costs, recall and precision of semi-automated workflows, incorporating MAG with adjunctive machine learning, for continually updating our living map. Resource use data (time use) were collected from information specialists and other researchers involved in map production. Our systematic review software, EPPI-Reviewer, was adapted to incorporate MAG and associated machine learning workflows, and also used to collect data on recall, precision, and manual screening workload.
Results
The semi-automated MAG-enabled workflow dominated conventional workflows in both the base case and sensitivity analyses. At one month our MAG-enabled workflow with machine learning, active learning and fixed screening targets identified 469 additional, eligible articles for inclusion in our living map, and cost £3,179 GBP per week less, compared with conventional methods relying on Boolean searches of Medline and Embase.
Conclusions
We were able to increase recall and coverage of a large living map, whilst reducing its production costs. This finding is likely to be transferrable to OpenAlex, MAG's successor database platform.","I. Shemilt, Anneliese Arno, James Thomas, T. Lorenc, Claire Khouja, G. Raine, K.

DL has made substantial advances in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer, particularly through the application of advanced models such as convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and generative adversarial networks. These models have delivered breakthrough performance in key areas, including ultrasound image analysis of thyroid nodules, automated classification of pathological images, and assessment of extrathyroidal extension. DL also shows considerable promise for individualized treatment planning and prognosis prediction. Nonetheless, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by substantial technical, clinical, and ethical challenges. Addressing these barriers is crucial to achieving meaningful improvements in thyroid cancer care and realizing the full potential of DL in precision medicine.
CONCLUSION
DL techniques are advancing the precision diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer and hold the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve therapeutic outcomes for patients.

SDN-Enabled IoT Security Frameworks—A Review of Existing Challenges,"This comprehensive systematic review examines the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) with IoT security frameworks, analyzing recent advancements in encryption, authentication, access control techniques, and intrusion detection systems. Our analysis reveals that while SDN demonstrates promising capabilities in enhancing IoT security through centralized control and dynamic policy enforcement, several critical limitations persist, particularly in scalability and real-world validation. As intrusion detection represents an integral security requirement for robust IoT frameworks, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques that have emerged as predominant approaches for threat detection in SDN-enabled IoT environments. The review categorizes and analyzes these ML/DL implementations across various architectural paradigms, identifying patterns in their effectiveness for different security contexts. Furthermore, recognizing that the performance of these ML/DL models critically depends on training data quality, we evaluate existing IoT security datasets, identifying significant gaps in representing contemporary attack vectors and realistic IoT environments. A key finding indicates that hybrid architectures integrating cloud–edge–fog computing demonstrate superior performance in distributing security workloads compared to single-tier implementations. Based on this systematic analysis, we propose key future research directions, including adaptive zero-trust architectures, federated machine learning for distributed security, and comprehensive dataset creation methodologies, that address current limitations in IoT security research.","Sandipan Rakeshkumar Mishra, Bharanidharan Shanmugam, Kheng Cher Yeo, Suresh Thennadil",10.3390/technologies13030121,https://doi.org/10.3390/technologies13030121,Technologies,5,2025,no,"The paper is a systematic review, but it focuses on SDN and IoT security rather than academic literature analysis.

Survey on Digital Sovereignty and Identity: From Digitization to Digitalization,"Through digital transformation, lots of personal data are captured, but individuals often do not have ownership or control over them. This results in the emerging Web 3.0, where people demand data sovereignty. There are actually two conceptually related terms, data sovereignty and digital sovereignty. This paper first explains these two concepts in terms of their points of focus, guiding principles, laws and regulations requirements, and then analyses the requirements and technical challenges of their implementation. To understand the emerging trend shift in digital sovereignty towards individuals taking control of security and privacy preserving over their own digital assets, this paper conducts a systematic review and analysis on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is a user-centric decentralized model and autonomy for an individual to self-determine the access and use of one's identity and credentials. The review covers existing SSI solutions and points out that an efficient key management system, the scalability and interoperability of the solution, and a well-established standard are some of the challenges for SSI deployment. Finally, the paper concludes with open issues about digital identity, including dynamic attributes, persona, and attribute ownership, that challenge the current reference architecture of SSI as well as its implementation.","Kheng-Leong Tan, Chi-Hung Chi, Kwok-Yan Lam",10.1145/3616400,https://doi.org/10.1145/3616400,ACM Computing Surveys,27,2023,no,"The paper does not focus on academic literature analysis, but instead focuses on digital sovereignty and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems.

An Iterative Systematic Analytical Review of Advanced Deep Learning Models for Grape Disease Detection,"The growth in plant disease occurrence has heavily threatened global agricultural productivity. Therefore, highly efficient and automated diagnostic tools need to be developed in the current scenario. Rapid advancement in machine learning and deep learning techniques makes present reviews far from conducting comprehensive comparative evaluations of cutting-edge models especially for important crops such as grapes related to plant disease detection. These reviews inadequately address the challenges of model interpretability, computational efficiency, and adaptability to various datasets, thus opening the doors for gaps in applying such technologies in actual farm-related settings. This paper seeks to address these limitations by doing a -guided systematic review of the latest ML and DL models including CNNs, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and hybrid ensemble approaches like DenseNet121, MobileNetV3Large, and Inception-ResNet-V2. The performance is evaluated in terms of major metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency. Some of the new architectures include dual-track networks with Swin Transformers and group shuffle residual deformable nets, among others like interpretable models LEViT and an interpretable leaf disease detector, I-LDD, which are specifically discussed in terms of new architecture and practicality benefit. In the light of impact on scalability and usability in agricultural domains, the emphases go to lightweight architectures that optimize deployment for edges and explainable frameworks improve decision-making capabilities. With this, an inclusive review proves helpful for better selections of optimum models toward the detection of grape disease as well as generalized plant pathology with precision advancements in agriculture scenarios. This work contributes to sustainable agricultural practices and enhances food security by bridging knowledge gaps and proposing scalable, efficient, and interpretable solutions.","Prashant G.

Knowledge Mapping of Human Activity Recognition Techniques for Assistive Living (A Systematic Review),"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a subject of research that identifies an individual’s activities for assistive living. The proliferation of ICT and sensor technology prompted HAR to flourish beyond unfathomable levels, having immense human-centric applications. The development of accurate HAR systems involves complex statistical and computational tasks from signal acquisition to activity classification. This research aims to conduct a systematic review of recent techniques proposed for each stage of HAR application development.
The review is conducted following Kitchenham principles, using Scopus and Web of Science databases. Firstly, research questions were formulated, followed by the search strategy definition. Based on assessment criteria, 193 papers are shortlisted and thoroughly analyzed to extract research-related information.
The techniques identified in 193 articles are comprehensively mapped from four aspects: data acquisition, data preprocessing and feature engineering, learning algorithm, and evaluation. Each technique is examined for its strengths and limitations to assist application developers in selecting the best one for their needs. The prevailing challenges and upcoming research opportunities are thoroughly explored.
The ever-expanding literature in the field necessitated an update to the status of HAR literature. Compared to other reviews that focused on specific methods, fields of application, and datatypes, to the best of our understanding, this is the first evaluation of its kind that provides a broader mapping of HAR approaches.

Artificial Intelligence in Food Safety: A Decade Review and Bibliometric Analysis,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been powerful solutions used to improve food yield, quality, and nutrition, increase safety and traceability while decreasing resource consumption, and eliminate food waste. Compared with several qualitative reviews on AI in food safety, we conducted an in-depth quantitative and systematic review based on the Core Collection database of WoS (Web of Science). To discover the historical trajectory and identify future trends, we analysed the literature concerning AI technologies in food safety from 2012 to 2022 by CiteSpace. In this review, we used bibliometric methods to describe the development of AI in food safety, including performance analysis, science mapping, and network analysis by CiteSpace. Among the 1855 selected articles, China and the United States contributed the most literature, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences released the largest number of relevant articles. Among all the journals in this field, PLoS ONE and Computers and Electronics in Agriculture ranked first and second in terms of annual publications and co-citation frequency. The present character, hot spots, and future research trends of AI technologies in food safety research were determined. Furthermore, based on our analyses, we provide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with the big picture of research on AI in food safety across the whole process, from precision agriculture to precision nutrition, through 28 enlightening articles.","Zhe Liu, Shuzhe Wang, Yudong Zhang, Yichen Feng, Jiajia Liu, Hengde Zhu",10.3390/foods12061242,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12061242,Foods,103,2023,yes,"The paper explicitly focuses on academic literature, using WoS (Web of Science) Core Collection database for analysis.",yes,"The paper strongly meets this criterion, using CiteSpace for bibliometric analysis, including performance analysis, science mapping, and network analysis.

Improving Students' Academic Performance with AI and Semantic Technologies,"Artificial intelligence and semantic technologies are evolving and have been applied in various research areas, including the education domain. Higher Education institutions strive to improve students' academic performance. Early intervention to at-risk students and a reasonable curriculum is vital for students' success. Prior research opted for deploying traditional machine learning models to predict students' performance. In terms of curriculum semantic analysis, after conducting a comprehensive systematic review regarding the use of semantic technologies in the Computer Science curriculum, a major finding of the study is that technologies used to measure similarity have limitations in terms of accuracy and ambiguity in the representation of concepts, courses, etc. To fill these gaps, in this study, three implementations were developed, that is, to predict students' performance using marks from the previous semester, to model a course representation in a semantic way and compute the similarity, and to identify the prerequisite between two similar courses. Regarding performance prediction, we used the combination of Genetic Algorithm and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) on a dataset from a Brazilian university containing 248730 records. As for similarity measurement, we deployed BERT to encode the sentences and used cosine similarity to obtain the distance between courses. With respect to prerequisite identification, TextRazor was applied to extract concepts from course description, followed by employing SemRefD to measure the degree of prerequisite between two concepts. The outcomes of this study can be summarized as: (i) a breakthrough result improves Manrique's work by 2.5% in terms of accuracy in dropout prediction; (ii) uncover the similarity between courses based on course description; (iii) identify the prerequisite over three compulsory courses of School of Computing at ANU.",Yi-Hua Cheng,-,-,-,3,2022,no,"The paper focuses on educational technology and curriculum analysis, but does not specifically focus on analyzing academic literature.

A Review of High-Sensitivity Tracking Techniques for Satellite Navigation Signals,"With the increasing demand for high-sensitivity signal tracking in complex environments, GNSS receiver technologies have continuously evolved in both architecture and algorithmic design. This paper presents a systematic review of the development of high-sensitivity tracking techniques, with a focus on the transition from closed-loop to open-loop, hybrid, and deeply integrated architectures. Key strategies—such as coherent integration time extension, discriminator and loop filter optimization, vector tracking (VT), and Direct Position Estimation (DPE) are evaluated in the context of weak signal scenarios. To address the limitations of existing methods, including strong dependence on filter models, oscillator instability, and computational complexity, this study also outlines future research directions, including (1) integrating deep learning techniques into filter structures to enhance adaptability and robustness; (2) developing multi-channel collaborative estimation schemes to mitigate oscillator noise in weak signal environments; and (3) designing low-complexity open-loop tracking approximations to align with hardware resource constraints. Thus, enhancing the necessity of navigation continuity and robustness under low-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions.","Zhiqiang Gong, Honglei Lin, Zhe Liu, Zengjun Liu, Long Huang, Gang Ou",10.3390/rs17101713,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17101713,Remote Sensing,1,2025,no,The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis at all.

A Systematic Literature Review on Emotion Recognition and Classification in Online Learning,"Emotion recognition is essential in online learning as it helps understand and respond to learners' emotions, improving the learning experience. For this reason, this study explores how multimodal data (such as text, images, and speech) can be used for emotion recognition and classification in online learning. While existing research primarily focuses on single‐modal emotion recognition, a systematic review of the integration of multiple data modalities is lacking. To fill this gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review to systematically explore the application of emotion recognition technologies in online learning from 2015 to 2024. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guideline, we identified 1712 publications, of which 62 were finally included in this study after careful screening and full‐text analysis. This paper is developed on four research questions: (1) identify the main methods and techniques in emotion recognition, pointing out that deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) are the mainstream methods; (2) analyze the commonly used datasets, and find that image and speech mostly relies on publicly datasets, while textual data is mostly based on self‐constructed datasets; (3) summarize the primary categories or dimensions of emotions, and find that binary and ternary classification are most common; and (4) sort out the main steps of emotion recognition, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. By focusing on the technical aspect of emotion recognition in online learning, this study provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for building intelligent, emotion‐aware learning systems in the future.","Xinmiao Zhang, Caixia Liu",10.1002/cpe.70428,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.70428,Concurrency and Computation,0,2025,no,"The paper is a systematic literature review, but it focuses on emotion recognition in online learning rather than academic literature management or search.

A Review of Video Text Retrieval Research,"Video text retrieval is a hot research topic in artificial intelligence, with the core challenge being the semantic gap between visual dynamic features and discrete linguistic symbols. In recent years, with the development of large-scale models, cross-modal modeling capabilities have significantly improved, driving continuous evolution in retrieval methods regarding granularity modeling strategies. This article provides a systematic review of research methods in video text retrieval, categorizing them into single-granularity retrieval and multi-granularity retrieval. Single-granularity retrieval focuses on modeling a single semantic layer. Coarse-grained methods achieve efficient retrieval through global feature matching using pre-trained models, but they suffer from incomplete semantic coverage. Fine-grained methods enhance semantic analysis accuracy through local alignment mechanisms, but they are constrained by inherent limitations. In contrast, multi-granularity retrieval combines global scene understanding and local detail perception through hierarchical feature fusion strategies, with typical technical approaches including dynamic fusion frameworks. Analysis results indicate that multi-granularity retrieval can more comprehensively capture cross-modal semantic associations, providing a more effective solution for video text retrieval.","Wang Yudi, JiaHui Wu, Zhengang Li, Wang Ya, Jin Ran, Corresponding Author",10.35444/ijana.202517204,https://doi.org/10.35444/ijana.202517204,International journal of advanced networking and applications,0,2025,no,"The paper focuses on video text retrieval rather than academic literature specifically.

Deep learning techniques for recommender systems based on collaborative filtering,"In the Big Data Era, recommender systems perform a fundamental role in data management and information filtering. In this context, Collaborative Filtering (CF) persists as one of the most prominent strategies to effectively deal with large datasets and is capable of offering users interesting content in a recommendation fashion. Nevertheless, it is well‐known CF recommenders suffer from data sparsity, mainly in cold‐start scenarios, substantially reducing the quality of recommendations. In the vast literature about the aforementioned topic, there are numerous solutions, in which the state‐of‐the‐art contributions are, in some sense, conditioned or associated with traditional CF methods such as Matrix Factorization (MF), that is, they rely on linear optimization procedures to model users and items into low‐dimensional embeddings. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, there has been an increasing number of studies exploring deep learning techniques in the CF context for latent factor modelling. In this research, authors conduct a systematic review focusing on state‐of‐the‐art literature on deep learning techniques applied in collaborative filtering recommendation, and also featuring primary studies related to mitigating the cold start problem. Additionally, authors considered the diverse non‐linear modelling strategies to deal with rating data and side information, the combination of deep learning techniques with traditional CF‐based linear methods, and an overview of the most used public datasets and evaluation metrics concerning CF scenarios.","Guilherme B.

A Review on Community Detection in Large Complex Networks from Conventional to Deep Learning Methods: A Call for the Use of Parallel Meta-Heuristic Algorithms,"Complex networks (CNs) have gained much attention in recent years due to their importance and popularity. The rapid growth in the size of CNs leads to more difficulties in the analysis of CNs tasks. Community Detection (CD) is an important multidisciplinary research area where many machine/deep learning-based methods have been applied to map CNs into a low-dimensional representation for extracting information similarity among members of CNs. Currently, Deep Learning (DL) is one of the promising methods to extract knowledge and learn information from high dimensional space and represent it in low dimensional space. However, designing an accurate and efficient DL-based CD method especially when dealing with large CNs is always an on-going research endeavor to pursue. Meta-Heuristic (MH) algorithms have shown their potentials in improving DL models in terms of solution quality and computational cost. In addition, parallel computing is a feasible solution for building efficient DL models. The algorithmic principle of MH is parallel in nature; however, its computation framework in DL training that is reported in the literature is not really implemented in a parallel computing setup. In this paper, we present a systematic review of CD in CNs from conventional machine learning to DL methods and point out the gap of applying DL-based CD methods in large CNs. In addition, the relevant studies on DL with parallel and MH approaches are reviewed and their implications on DL models are highlighted to prospect effective solutions to overcome the challenges of DL-based CD methods. We also point out research challenges in the field of CD and suggest possible future research directions.","M. Al-Andoli, Shing Chiang Tan, W.

Smart sprayers based on machine vision (MV) and artificial intelligence (AI) are keys to improving crop productivity and meeting the food demands of the future by reducing the yield losses due to weeds and working towards a sustainable future in agriculture. Many papers published in recent years have focused more on the machine vision, weed detection, and classification aspects of the weeding robot. Very few studies have attempted to discuss the components of a smart weeding machine, non-chemical-based weeders, the components of spraying systems, their controls, underlying fluid mechanics, and the field trials of these weeding robots. This article reviews conventional weeding techniques, machine-vision-based weeding robots, and spraying systems proposed or constructed in the last twenty-five years. Key technologies such as non-chemical-based weeding machines, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and weed detection based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for smart sprayers are discussed. The fundamental components of a smart spraying system are also discussed, and previous works are compared to highlight the key components, the spraying accuracy, and the major advantages and disadvantages. The fluid mechanics of the spraying system and its associated controls involved are also presented. There are still many bottlenecks in weed detection systems and smart spraying systems. The results of the systematic review provide an understanding of the progress made in the field of robotic weed detection, herbicide and non-herbicide-based weed management, the use of machine vision, and the limitations of the current spraying systems.","Vinay Vijayakumar, Y.

State-of-the-art in human-centric studies of AI-enhanced situational awareness within the security domain,"Advanced situational awareness and decision-making systems in the security domain heavily build upon versatile combinations of different artificial intelligence models, potentially including their earlier versions. Often, the broad variety of implemented algorithms results in complex system architectures which may challenge human comprehension of expert users. System performance is frequently evaluated by different technical metrics against various data sets, such as model accuracy, precision, and recall. However, without any consideration of human-autonomy teaming or human-system interaction, the possibilities of executing comprehensive system assessments are likely to remain limited. This systematic review examines the current state-of-the-art in human-centric studies on situational awareness systems applying machine learning or artificial intelligence as key technologies.

RecCite: A Hybrid Approach to Recommend Potential Papers,"A systematic review of literature is a crucial aspect in pursuing any research problem. With the galloping growth in the number of researchers and scientific publications available online in digital libraries, there is information overload which makes the search of relevant papers cumbersome. An efficient academic paper recommendation process could be a promising maneuver for this purpose. The state-of-the-art methods in this domain primarily employ link-based approaches on citation network and do not consider the semantics (context) of papers being recommended, although the later one largely accounts for the relevance of recommendations. Also achieving online response time (scalability) is a perennial desire for any recommendation system. In this context we propose a hybrid approach “RecCite” that blends the popularity of papers with semantic similarity to acquire relevance. Further, the approach follows a top-down methodology for filtering papers from a more generic and larger network to a community pertaining to a SIG (Special Interest Group) that inherently addresses the scalability aspect. The proposed approach has been systematically evaluated with state-of-the-art baseline method using the publicly available Arnet-Miner data set. Satisfyingly, “RecCite” outperforms the baseline method with up to 37.66%, 20.14%, and 97.24% improvement in precision, recall, and response time, respectively.","Pratyush Yadav, Nikhila Remala, N.

"Deep Learning in Multiple Instance Learning: Methods, Applications, and Research Trends","Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a flexible learning framework where data is organized into sets of instances, called bags, with a single label assigned to the entire bag instead of individual instances. This formulation is especially suitable for addressing complex problems by allowing greater flexibility in their representation using weakly labeled data. As in other learning frameworks, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been applied to solve MIL problems showing very interesting results. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive review of all recent research efforts on DL based on MIL. Thus, 173 papers published from 2016 are analyzed. A unified taxonomy is proposed that relates DL architectures with MIL strategies and learning frameworks, providing an integrated view on their interactions. In addition, the main types of architectures, learning frameworks, assumptions, applications, datasets, and tools are discussed in detail. Relevant findings indicate that Convolutional Neural Networks remain the most commonly used architectures, with a growing trend toward hybrid models that incorporate attention mechanisms, transformers, or recurrent networks. While early MIL approaches primarily relied on instance-based strategies under the standard assumption, more recent studies reveal a clear shift toward the extended assumption, particularly within hybrid architectures. Bag-based strategies remain less prevalent and are mainly explored through hybrid models. Most of the reviewed studies focus on classification tasks, where the diversity of MIL assumptions and architectural choices is more pronounced, while regression tasks have been addressed less frequently. Regarding the applications, medical diagnosis is the most widely used application, with the most available resources. Also, it was found that Python is the most frequently used tool in the reviewed papers. Finally, we point out the open issues and future research directions. Some key challenges such as the adaptation of generative architectures in unsupervised learning and the improvement of robustness in the models are still open to be addressed.","Mustafa A Jalil, A.

Systematic review on neural architecture search,"Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various fields, enabling the development of intelligent systems capable of solving complex problems. However, the process of manually designing and optimizing ML models is often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires specialized expertise. To address these challenges, Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) has emerged as a promising approach that automates the process of selecting and optimizing ML models. Within the realm of AutoML, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful technique that automates the design of neural network architectures, the core components of ML models. It has recently gained significant attraction due to its capability to discover novel and efficient architectures that surpass human-designed counterparts. This manuscript aims to present a systematic review of the literature on this topic published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze, and classify the different types of algorithms developed for NAS. The methodology follows the guidelines of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methods. Consequently, this study identified 160 articles that provide a comprehensive overview of the field of NAS, encompassing discussion on current works, their purposes, conclusions, and predictions of the direction of this science branch in its main core pillars: Search Space (SSp), Search Strategy (SSt), and Validation Strategy (VSt). Subsequently, the key milestones and advancements that have shaped the field are highlighted. Moreover, we discuss the challenges and open issues that remain in the field.

Mitigating Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in IIoT Systems: Challenges and Advances in AI-Powered Intrusion Detection Systems,"Zero-day attacks are one of the great challenges that intrusion detection systems have been facing and keep on facing today, especially worsening within Industrial Internet of Things environments since their ability to take advantage of unknown vulnerabilities results in a high rate of false negatives. It is under this framework that this paper presents a set of experiments that have been carried out with the objective of analyzing the consequences of zero-day attacks with regard to performance degradation in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and, secondly, and with greater emphasis, about those failings which have been pointed out up to now as those affecting precision in detection. This has been done through the systematic review of 200 research papers published from the years 2023 to 2024, further categorized into the four main focus areas: general AI-based IDS, Machine learning (ML)-based IDS, Deep Learning (DL)-based IDS, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS. Accordingly, 45% were DL-based IDS reviews; 35% related to machine learning; 15% consisted of the ones about DRL-based ones, while 5% pertain to the General AI-based ones. Results show that the approaches with DL-based systems will come up with extensive promises, reducing the impact brought by false negatives, besides extending the issues even when one considers a background of adversarial attack issues. It underlines that, in IDS, apart from accuracy, detection specificity and recall are also of essence for dealing with low frequent but high-impact zero-day threats. These techniques further make the following proposal: the use of both machine learning and deep learning techniques should be improved in enhancing the performance of IDS.","Khalid Asaad Hashim, Yusnani Binti Mohd Yussoff1, Shahrani Binti Shahbudin",10.58496//mjcs/2025/063,https://doi.org/10.58496//mjcs/2025/063,Mesopotamian Journal of CyberSecurity,0,2025,yes,"The paper is a systematic review of academic literature (200 research papers), so it meets this criterion.

"Industrial Site Selection: Methodologies, Advances and Challenges","Industrial site selection holds strategic importance in the layout of industrial facilities. Scientific decision-making in site selection not only enhances the economic and technical feasibility of a project but also lays the foundation for sustainable development. However, industrial site selection is considered an NP-hard problem. The criteria used to evaluate site suitability, the methods proven effective under different conditions, big data sources introduced, and the key data gaps, methodological limitations, and research priorities to improve decision quality are important for researchers and engineers.

Advancing Intelligent Toolpath Generation: A Systematic Review of CAD–CAM Integration in Industry 4.0 and 5.0,"This systematic literature review investigates advancements in intelligent computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD–CAM) integration and toolpath generation, analyzing their evolution across Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0 (I5.0) paradigms. Using the theory–context–characteristics–methodology framework, the study synthesizes 51 peer-reviewed studies (from 2000 to 2025) to map theoretical foundations, industrial applications, technical innovations, and methodological trends. Findings reveal that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning dominate research, driving breakthroughs in feature recognition, adaptive toolpath optimization, and predictive maintenance. However, human-centric frameworks central to I5.0, such as socio-technical collaboration, remain underexplored. High-precision sectors (aerospace, biomedical) lead adoption, while small and medium enterprises (SMEs) lag due to resource constraints. Technologically, AI-driven automation and STEP-NC standards show promise, yet interoperability gaps persist due to fragmented data models and legacy systems. Methodologically, AI-based modeling prevails (49 % of studies), but experimental validation and socio-technical frameworks are sparse. Key gaps include limited real-time adaptability, insufficient AI training datasets, and slow adoption of sustainable practices. The review highlights the urgent need for standardized data exchange protocols, scalable solutions for SMEs, and human-AI collaboration models to align CAD–CAM integration with I5.0’s sustainability and resilience goals. By bridging these gaps, this work provides a roadmap for advancing intelligent, human-centered manufacturing ecosystems.","Marko Simonič, I. Palčič, S.

"Augmented Reality (AR) for Surgical Robotic and Autonomous Systems: State of the Art, Challenges, and Solutions","Despite the substantial progress achieved in the development and integration of augmented reality (AR) in surgical robotic and autonomous systems (RAS), the center of focus in most devices remains on improving end-effector dexterity and precision, as well as improved access to minimally invasive surgeries. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of different types of state-of-the-art surgical robotic platforms while identifying areas for technological improvement. We associate specific control features, such as haptic feedback, sensory stimuli, and human–robot collaboration, with AR technology to perform complex surgical interventions for increased user perception of the augmented world. Current researchers in the field have, for long, faced innumerable issues with low accuracy in tool placement around complex trajectories, pose estimation, and difficulty in depth perception during two-dimensional medical imaging. A number of robots described in this review, such as Novarad and SpineAssist, are analyzed in terms of their hardware features, computer vision systems (such as deep learning algorithms), and the clinical relevance of the literature. We attempt to outline the shortcomings in current optimization algorithms for surgical robots (such as YOLO and LTSM) whilst providing mitigating solutions to internal tool-to-organ collision detection and image reconstruction. The accuracy of results in robot end-effector collisions and reduced occlusion remain promising within the scope of our research, validating the propositions made for the surgical clearance of ever-expanding AR technology in the future.","Jenna Seetohul, Mahmood Shafiee, K.

Systematic Review of Issues in Identification and Detection of Malicious URLs Using GNN,"The threat of cybersecurity continues to rise as malicious URLs have become one of the most critical threats for phishing attacks, malware distribution and identity theft. But the phishing URLs exploit trust built in users to get their sensitive data and cause significant financial losses, operational disruptions and damage to an individual's and organizations' reputation. Current detection approaches, including Machine Learning (ML) techniques are based on traditional means and insufficient against the modern and evolving phishing techniques. URL features such as structure, domain reputation, and content are analyzed using ML models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural networks (NN) to increase detection accuracy. These models suffer from scalability, real time adaptability, and zero-hour phishing attacks detection which takes advantage of newly discovered vulnerabilities in software or systems before a patch or fix is available. This paper proposes an innovative approach for real time, user friendly malicious URL detection by integrating the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into a chatbot interface. Advanced approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers can improve detection performance by integrating contextual relationships and semantic analysis. In addition to this, it also studies URL masking, false positives and the complexity of feature engineering.

A Systematic Literature Review of Hallucinations in Large Language Models,"This review systematically maps research on hallucinations in large language models using a descriptive scheme that links model outputs to four system architectures: unaugmented generation, post-hoc reactive validation, proactive detection-and-mitigation, and fully integrated detection-and-mitigation designs. Our methodology for this systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility. We searched IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect for studies published between 2015 and January 2025 and extracted 125 peer-reviewed papers across nine application domains. Quantitative analysis shows that question answering and multimodal tasks account for 48% of all papers, whereas software engineering, educational technology, and autonomous systems are underexplored. Although 87.5% of the studies rely on additional reactive or proactive defenses, only 8.8% implement integrated architecture-level safeguards, revealing a critical gap in unified and dynamic architectures. The resulting classification matrix and domain map provide a diagnostic tool for locating blind spots and comparing architectural maturity. Three actionable priorities emerge: develop integrated reasoning-and-verification loops that pre-empt hallucinations; transfer proven causal-intervention and multi-agent validation pipelines to high-stakes, under-represented domains and benchmark them under real conditions; and build modular, cross-domain evaluation frameworks that isolate the contribution of individual mitigation components and support ablation studies. By consolidating fragmented evidence and quantifying architecture-domain imbalances, this review establishes a traceable foundation for engineering reliable, explainable, and domain-adaptable countermeasures to hallucinations in generative language technology.","Christian Woesle, Leopold Fischer-Brandies, Ricardo Buettner",10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3601206,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3601206,IEEE Access,2,2025,yes,"The paper is a systematic review of academic literature, specifically focusing on research papers from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect.

A Systematic Review of Medical Expert Systems for Cardiac Arrest Prediction,"Predicting cardiac arrest is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient
outcomes. Machine learning has yielded astounding results by offering tailored prediction analyses
on complex data. Despite advancements in medical expert systems, there remains a need for a
comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness and limitations in cardiac arrest prediction. This need
arises because there are not enough existing studies that thoroughly cover the topic.
The systematic review aims to analyze the existing literature on medical expert systems
for cardiac arrest prediction, filling the gaps in knowledge and identifying key challenges.
This paper adopts the PRISMA methodology to conduct a systematic review of 37 publications
obtained from PubMed, Springer, ScienceDirect, and IEEE, published within the last decade.
Careful inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied during the selection process, resulting in a
comprehensive analysis that utilizes five integrated layers- research objectives, data collection, feature
set generation, model training and validation employing various machine learning techniques.
The findings indicate that current studies frequently use ensemble and deep
learning methods to improve machine learning predictions’ accuracy. However, they lack adequate
implementation of proper pre-processing techniques. Further research is needed to address challenges
related to external validation, implementation, and adoption of machine learning models in real
clinical settings, as well as integrating machine learning with AI technologies like NLP. This review
aims to be a valuable resource for both novice and experienced researchers, offering insights into
current methods and potential future recommendations.","Ishleen Kaur, Tanvir Ahmad, M. N.

Rise of Deep Learning Clinical Applications and Challenges in Omics Data: A Systematic Review,"This research aims to review and evaluate the most relevant scientific studies about deep learning (DL) models in the omics field. It also aims to realize the potential of DL techniques in omics data analysis fully by demonstrating this potential and identifying the key challenges that must be addressed. Numerous elements are essential for comprehending numerous studies by surveying the existing literature. For example, the clinical applications and datasets from the literature are essential elements. The published literature highlights the difficulties encountered by other researchers. In addition to looking for other studies, such as guidelines, comparative studies, and review papers, a systematic approach is used to search all relevant publications on omics and DL using different keyword variants. From 2018 to 2022, the search procedure was conducted on four Internet search engines: IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. These indexes were chosen because they offer enough coverage and linkages to numerous papers in the biological field. A total of 65 articles were added to the final list. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified. Of the 65 publications, 42 are clinical applications of DL in omics data. Furthermore, 16 out of 65 articles comprised the review publications based on single- and multi-omics data from the proposed taxonomy.

The hunt for the last relevant paper: blending the best of humans and AI,"ABSTRACT Background: The exponential growth of research literature makes it increasingly difficult to identify all relevant studies for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. While traditional search methods are labour-intensive, modern AI-aided approaches have the potential to act as a powerful ‘super-assistant’ during both the searching and screening phases. Objective: This paper evaluates how a combined, open-source approach – merging traditional and AI-aided search and screening methods – can help identify all relevant literature up to the ‘last relevant paper’ for a systematic review on post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories after traumatic events. Method: We applied eight search strategies, including database searches, snowballing, full-text retrieval, and semantic search via OpenAlex. All records were screened using a combination of human reviewers, active learning, and large language models (LLMs) for quality control. Results: On top of replicating the original 6,701 search results, we identified an additional 3,822 records using AI-aided methods. The combination of AI tools and human screening led to 126 relevant studies, with each method uncovering papers the others missed. Notably, machine-aided techniques helped find studies with missing keywords, unusual phrasing, or limited indexing. Across all AI-assisted strategies, 10 additional studies were identified, and while the overall yield was modest, these papers were unique and relevant and would likely have been missed using traditional methods. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that even when returns are low, AI-aided approaches can meaningfully enhance coverage and offer a scalable path forward when combined with screening prioritisation. A transparent, hybrid workflow where AI serves as a ‘super-assistant’ can meaningfully extend the reach of systematic reviews and increase the quality of the findings, but is not ready to replace humans fully.","R. van de Schoot, Bruno Messina Coimbra, Tale Evenhuis, Peter Lombaers, F.

Deep Learning Based Methods for Molecular Similarity Searching: A Systematic Review,"In rational drug design, the concept of molecular similarity searching is frequently used to identify molecules with similar functionalities by looking up structurally related molecules in chemical databases. Different methods have been developed to measure the similarity of molecules to a target query. Although the approaches perform effectively, particularly when dealing with molecules with homogenous active structures, they fall short when dealing with compounds that have heterogeneous structural compounds. In recent times, deep learning methods have been exploited for improving the performance of molecule searching due to their feature extraction power and generalization capabilities. However, despite numerous research studies on deep-learning-based molecular similarity searches, relatively few secondary research was carried out in the area. This research aims to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) on deep-learning-based molecular similarity searches to enable researchers and practitioners to better understand the current trends and issues in the field. The study accesses 875 distinctive papers from the selected journals and conferences, which were published over the last thirteen years (2010–2023). After the full-text eligibility analysis and careful screening of the abstract, 65 studies were selected for our SLR. The review’s findings showed that the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and autoencoders (AEs) are the most frequently used deep learning models for molecular similarity searching; next are the models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) techniques. The ChEMBL dataset and DrugBank standard dataset are the two datasets that are most frequently used for the evaluation of deep learning methods for molecular similarity searching based on the results. In addition, the results show that the most popular methods for optimizing the performance of molecular similarity searching are new representation approaches and reweighing features techniques, and, for evaluating the efficiency of deep-learning-based molecular similarity searching, the most widely used metrics are the area under the curve (AUC) and precision measures.","Maged Nasser, U.

Systematic Review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques for Spatiotemporal Air Quality Prediction,"Background: Although computational models are advancing air quality prediction, achieving the desired performance or accuracy of prediction remains a gap, which impacts the implementation of machine learning (ML) air quality prediction models. Several models have been employed and some hybridized to enhance air quality and air quality index predictions. The objective of this paper is to systematically review machine and deep learning techniques for spatiotemporal air prediction challenges. Methods: In this review, a methodological framework based on PRISMA flow was utilized in which the initial search terms were defined to guide the literature search strategy in online data sources (Scopus and Google Scholar). The inclusion criteria are articles published in the English language, document type (articles and conference papers), and source type (journal and conference proceedings). The exclusion criteria are book series and books. The authors’ search strategy was complemented with ChatGPT-generated keywords to reduce the risk of bias. Report synthesis was achieved by keyword grouping using Microsoft Excel, leading to keyword sorting in ascending order for easy identification of similar and dissimilar keywords. Three independent researchers were used in this research to avoid bias in data collection and synthesis. Articles were retrieved on 27 July 2024. Results: Out of 374 articles, 80 were selected as they were in line with the scope of the study. The review identified the combination of a machine learning technique and deep learning techniques for data limitations and processing of the nonlinear characteristics of air pollutants. ML models, such as random forest, and decision tree classifier were among the commonly used models for air quality index and air quality predictions, with promising performance results. Deep learning models are promising due to the hyper-parameter components, which consist of activation functions suitable for nonlinear spatiotemporal data. The emergence of low-cost devices for data limitations is highlighted, in addition to the use of transfer learning and federated learning models. Again, it is highlighted that military activities and fires impact the O3 concentration, and the best-performing models highlighted in this review could be helpful in developing predictive models for air quality prediction in areas with heavy military activities. Limitation: This review acknowledges methodological challenges in terms of data collection sources, as there are equally relevant materials on other online data sources. Again, the choice and use of keywords for the initial search and the creation of subsequent filter keywords limit the collection of other relevant research articles.","I. E. Agbehadji, I.

Skin Cancer Classification With Deep Learning: A Systematic Review,"Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world. Correctly classifying skin lesions at an early stage could aid clinical decision-making by providing an accurate disease diagnosis, potentially increasing the chances of cure before cancer spreads. However, achieving automatic skin cancer classification is difficult because the majority of skin disease images used for training are imbalanced and in short supply; meanwhile, the model’s cross-domain adaptability and robustness are also critical challenges. Recently, many deep learning-based methods have been widely used in skin cancer classification to solve the above issues and achieve satisfactory results. Nonetheless, reviews that include the abovementioned frontier problems in skin cancer classification are still scarce. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest deep learning-based algorithms for skin cancer classification. We begin with an overview of three types of dermatological images, followed by a list of publicly available datasets relating to skin cancers. After that, we review the successful applications of typical convolutional neural networks for skin cancer classification. As a highlight of this paper, we next summarize several frontier problems, including data imbalance, data limitation, domain adaptation, model robustness, and model efficiency, followed by corresponding solutions in the skin cancer classification task. Finally, by summarizing different deep learning-based methods to solve the frontier challenges in skin cancer classification, we can conclude that the general development direction of these approaches is structured, lightweight, and multimodal. Besides, for readers’ convenience, we have summarized our findings in figures and tables. Considering the growing popularity of deep learning, there are still many issues to overcome as well as chances to pursue in the future.","Yinhao Wu, B.

Current Status and Trends in Rumor Governance: A Visual Analysis based on CiteSpace,"[Purpose/Significance] With the advent of the 5G era and the rapid development of the internet, the speed and modes of rumor dissemination have continuously evolved. This study employs bibliometric methods to conduct a systematic review and visual analysis of scholarly articles on rumor governance, aiming to clarify the research landscape, key features, hotspots, and future directions in this field. [Methods/Process] Utilizing data from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Web of Science (WoS) core databases, this study applies CiteSpace, a bibliometric analysis tool, to examine publication trends, highly cited authors, prolific researchers, keyword co-occurrence patterns, and thematic clusters from60 2012 to 2024. [Results/Conclusion] The findings indicate that foreign researchers exhibit high publication productivity and strong collaborative networks, whereas domestic researchers are relatively dispersed with weaker cooperative ties. Keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis reveal that domestic research predominantly focuses on the practical implementation of governance strategies, emphasizing macro-level frameworks such as ""collaborative governance,"" and primarily employing qualitative methodologies to propose policy recommendations and localized practices. In contrast, international studies prioritize the universality of communication models, utilizing quantitative methods and model construction to examine the micro-level mechanisms influencing individual behavior and collective emotions. Future research should integrate the contextual depth of case studies with the generalizability of quantitative models to explore user psychology, the long-term societal impacts of rumors, and the role of legal frameworks in rumor governance. Additionally, cross-cultural research should be expanded to analyze the mechanisms of rumor dissemination across different cultural contexts and governance models, addressing the challenges posed by the globalization of information dissemination.","Zhixuan Zhang, Yi Zhang, Dandan Wang",10.62051/ijsspa.v6n2.19,https://doi.org/10.62051/ijsspa.v6n2.19,International Journal of Social Sciences and Public Administration,0,2025,yes,"The paper is clearly focused on academic literature, using CNKI and Web of Science core databases for analysis.",yes,"The study explicitly uses bibliometric methods and CiteSpace for citation analysis, including publication trends and highly cited authors.",yes,"The study goes beyond basic database management by applying bibliometric analysis tools and conducting visual analysis, keyword co-occurrence patterns, and thematic clustering.",maybe,"While the study includes keyword co-occurrence analysis, it doesn't explicitly mention knowledge graph construction or deep semantic analysis.",maybe,"The abstract doesn't explicitly mention NLP or ML techniques, though the analysis methods might include these.",maybe,"While the study analyzes publication patterns, it doesn't specifically focus on paper discovery or recommendation algorithms.",yes,"The paper appears to be a full research study with substantial technical content, including detailed methodology and analysis.",no,The paper focuses on analyzing rumor governance literature rather than technical architectures for literature review systems.,Exclude,"A bibliometric study utilizing academic databases and advanced analytical techniques, demonstrating strong capabilities in citation analysis, publication trend examination, and thematic clustering.

Toward carbon neutrality: a bibliometric analysis of technological innovation and global emission reductions,"In the context of global carbon neutrality, climate change mitigation and response has become a top priority. Currently, countries around the world are setting emission reduction targets or are already involved in carbon-neutral actions, with technological innovation becoming the key to global emission reduction. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature related to technology innovation and emission reduction in response to carbon-neutral actions for climate change is conducted. A global bibliometric visualization analysis is presented using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. This study visualizes the basic relationship between global emission reduction and technology-related literature under the carbon neutrality target and analyzes and discusses the spatial distribution and hotspot trends of the co-author network and knowledge base. The results show that (1) the trend of the number of relevant studies can be divided into two phases before and after, and starts to increase gradually after 2020. (2) The structural relationship of the author- and institution-based cooperative networks is relatively loose, and the main cooperative networks, mainly by countries, are initially formed by the key contributions of developed and emerging economies. (3) Relevant research hotspots are reflected in multiple perspectives such as investment, management, and policy, in addition to emission reduction targets and technological innovation itself. The causal relationship between relevant research and economic and political dimensions has become an important driving factor for research development. Especially in the paradigm shift phase, there are research characteristics of human intervention and specific actions. (4) In terms of future trends, research involving policy management, methodological efficiency, and systemic models will become important research paths in the future by matching the supply of actions to real needs.

"Technological convergence in the metaverse: challenges and solutions from blockchain, AI, and digital rights","Introduction:The convergence of blockchain, the metaverse, and artificial intelligence (AI) has generated significant transformations in the management of privacy, security, intellectual property, and freedom of expression in digital environments. This research explored the technical, legal, and ethical implications arising from this technological interaction.Methods:A systematic review of scientific literature published between 2022 and 2024 was conducted, selecting 35 studies indexed in databases such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and arXiv. A qualitative-quantitative approach was applied to categorize findings into comparative matrices and analyze patterns, regulatory gaps, and proposed solutions.Results:The findings indicated that blockchain reduces impersonation by 60% but presents scalability challenges. AI improved the detection of harmful speech (AUC-ROC: 0.91), albeit with cultural biases. In intellectual property, NFTs offered greater authenticity (β = 0.76), but collaborative works lacked sufficient traceability. Hybrid solutions proved effective against unfair censorship.Conclusions:It was concluded that no single technology is sufficient; multi-layered architecture is recommended that integrates blockchain as an audit layer, AI as an adaptive mechanism, and DAO governance for the metaverse, under interoperable and ethically sound legal frameworks.","José Humberto Puente, Gerardo Contreras-Piña",10.56294/mr2024.108,https://doi.org/10.56294/mr2024.108,Metaverse Basic and Applied Research,1,2024,maybe,"The paper is a systematic review of academic literature, specifically analyzing 35 studies from academic databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, arXiv).

9 Hierarchical arrangement of scholarly and novel information (HASANI): a digital platform to synthesize research evidence in real time,"Objectives Our main objective is to create a real time evidence generating platform for the most uptodate evidence-based practice with following specific goals. Implement a digital curation framework to automate knowledge extraction and summerization of published and unpublished publications Implement a critical appraisal process at the time of publication submission to journals. Implement an integrated visual abstract application for authors to submit critically appraised elements of the study Implement an automated data analytical interface to generate automated systematic reviews and meta–analysis Implement a platform API for publishers to automatically summarize their published papers for automated systematic reviews and met analysis. Method We designed and implemented a platform for automating the research evidence synthesis. The application is implemented as SaaS-based model in angular JS framework with Application program interface (API) to integrate with online journals. This creates an opportunity to synthesize research evidence in real time for a given research topic, population or territory. Each publisher or organization can customize templates for various study types to create automated systematic review, meta-analysis, and qualitative review studies Results A beta testing of our platform (HASANI) has been conducted to display the automated article summary creation from critical appraisal elements. Preliminary beta study results confirmed that our framework was efficient in identifying, curating and synthesizing the literature article summary of a given article to pool against similar studies. This strategy not only saves time and money in synthesizing new research evidence, but also provides a platform for insuring a quality research publication as it eliminates a human bias and errors. A real time automated pooling of similar research studies expedites a creation of automated systematic reviews generation which addresses the research publication overload in coming years Conclusions We have designed and implemented a web-based automated literature reading and curating framework for research evidence synthesis in real time. Our initial findings provide supportive evidence of automating the literature curating and extraction strategy. In addition, it provides an excellent future digital curation strategy for journal publishers to streamline the synthesis of research evidence by requesting authors to submit the pre-appraised critical elements of the relevant study types. This strategy provides a reassurance to academic audience that published articles have been formally appraised to be included in building a research evidence towards a particular topic or subject. More importantly, a real-time knowledge synthesis from this strategy will provide a more robust and uptodate practice guidelines for clinicians to focus on interpretation of research findings for applicability in their patient population, rather waiting for new systematic review and meta-analysis creation.","Izhar Hasan, Uzair Hasan, Babar Rao, Salman Habib Abbasi",10.1136/bmjebm-2019-EBMLive.17,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2019-EBMLive.17,Oral Presentations,0,2019,yes,"The paper is clearly focused on academic literature, specifically dealing with research evidence synthesis and systematic reviews.

Deep learning techniques for stock market forecasting,"Stock is a long-term credit tool in the capital market, which can be transferred and traded. Therefore, the stock market has emerged. It is a place for stock issuance and trading, and plays an important role in today's world economy. More and more people are now beginning to pay attention to the stock market and invest, so the stock price prediction has become a concern. People begin to develop various methods to predict the stock price to comply with the market demand. In the stock market, the market changes are related to the national macroeconomic development, the formulation of laws and regulations, the operation of the company, the confidence of shareholders, and so on. This prediction behavior is based only on assumed factors and established preconditions. As a result, stock forecasting is difficult to predict accurately. People focus on developing various systems that can make stock price prediction more accurate and faster. Although there have been many studies on predicting stock prices, there is no systematic review to revise the state-of-the-art research on stock market prediction. Therefore, we should make a new review of stock price prediction methods and make a systematic summary, review, and comparative analysis of the new methods in recent years.","Yifei Chen, Jiaxin Shen, Runyu Tian, Yeming Wang",10.1117/12.2628033,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2628033,Other Conferences,0,2022,no,"The paper is about stock market prediction and does not focus on academic literature analysis.

Utilizing intelligent technologies in construction and demolition waste management: From a systematic review to an implementation framework,"Abstract The rapid increase in global urbanization, along with the growth of the construction industry, highlights the urgent need for effective management of construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste. Intelligent technologies offer a viable solution to this critical challenge. However, there remains a significant challenge in integrating these technologies into a cohesive framework. This study conducts a quantitative analysis of 214 papers from 2000 to 2023, highlighting the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and building information modeling (BIM), along with geographic information systems (GIS) and big data (BD). A further qualitative analysis of 73 selected papers investigates the use of seven different intelligent technologies in the context of C&amp;D waste management (CDWM). To overcome current limitations in knowledge, future research should concentrate on (1) the comprehensive integration of technology, (2) inclusive studies throughout all lifecycle phases of CDWM, and (3) the continued examination of new technologies, such as blockchain. Based on these insights, this study suggests a strategic framework for the effective implementation of intelligent technologies in CDWM. This framework aims to assist professionals in merging various technologies, undertaking lifecycle-wide research, and narrowing the divide between existing and new technologies. It also lays a solid foundation for future academic work to examine specific intelligent technologies, conduct comparative studies, and refine strategic decisions. Regular updates on technological developments are essential for stakeholders to consistently enhance CDWM standards.","Zezhou Wu, Tianjia Pei, Zhikang Bao, NG S.Thomas, Guoyang Lu, Ke Chen, Front.

RAG-Driven Memory Architectures in Conversational LLMs—A Literature Review With Insights Into Emerging Agriculture Data Sharing,"Despite significant advances in natural language processing, conversational AI systems face persistent challenges in maintaining extensive and contextually coherent dialogues, particularly regarding long-term memory management. This literature review synthesizes current approaches to memory architectures in conversational AI, examining the transition from basic dialogue agents to more sophisticated, agentic frameworks. We analyze how vector databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address fundamental challenges in storing and retrieving conversational context, maintaining system responsiveness, managing user-specific data ethically, and integrating domain-specific information. Through systematic review of papers, we identify critical limitations of vector embedding in capturing extended conversational context, particularly in agentic domains requiring semantic, episodic, procedural, and emotional memory. We evaluate how RAG frameworks can augment vector databases to handle memory-intensive tasks requiring real-time updates and domain-specific knowledge integration. Furthermore, we examine alternative architectures including knowledge graphs, finite state machines, and hybrid solutions, highlighting the data quality and ethical challenges that must be addressed for scalable, reliable AI memory management. Our analysis provides a structured framework for understanding memory evolution in conversational AI, identifies gaps in current RAG solutions, proposes hybrid memory designs, and outlines future research directions emphasizing cross-domain applications in agriculture.","Nur Arifin Akbar, Rahool Dembani, B.

"AI‐Augmented Search for Systematic Reviews: 
A Comparative Analysis","Researchers are increasingly seeking to automate systematic review workflows to reduce time and labor. However, AI‐generated search strategies often contain errors that can significantly undermine the reliability of the evidence. To evaluate the relevancy and reproducibility of automated search strategies, we conducted a comparative analysis between a human‐in‐the‐loop system with a neurosymbolic AI framework (i.e., NeuroLit Navigator) and three AI systems that primarily rely on generative language models: Scite, Consensus, and Perplexity. Results showed that through an iterative human‐in‐the‐loop approach, NeuroLit Navigator produced more precise and focused search strategies aligned with domain‐specific terminologies compared to commercial LLM‐based systems, which presented issues such as lack of reproducibility and interpretability. This study highlights the potential of human‐AI collaboration in systematic review workflows, suggesting that AI should augment, rather than replace, librarian expertise.

Augmented Reality with Deep Learning in Smart Education: A Survey of Advances and Challenges,"AR has transformed immersion and interactivity in the learning process so that students could learn outside of the four classroom walls. Deep learning is helping make AR applications smarter and responsive and personalized. Deep learning allows an AR system to recognize objects in real time, detect gestures and create responsive content, to learn and interact more with students and become more responsive to student needs. In the context of AR and deep learning integrated into smart education, students and educators will be able to access dynamic tools to visualize abstract concepts and simulate experiments and to build collaborative online spaces. The current paper presents a systematic review of the advances and challenges in the incorporation of AR and deep learning into the models of smart education. It addresses already available applications of virtual laboratories and anatomy simulation and language learning and STEM-based training. The use of technological enablers such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize images, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to dissect speech, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create fake educational content are also discussed. Despite these promising perspectives of AR with deep learning in education, several difficulties remain. These include the issue of hardware independence, information privacy, explainability of models, and the digital divide between access to resource education and restricted resources education. This paper recommends that such challenges must be overcome so that access to and the adoption of such technologies can be made fair. Transparent AR learning environments, lightweight models on mobile devices, and AR platform global education can be considered as future research directions.

Editorial: Ecosystems-centered health and care innovation,"The rapid evolution of healthcare technologies has reshaped the way services are delivered, regulated, and perceived by stakeholders. From semantic interoperability in electronic health records to cloud-based regulatory platforms and precision medicine, these innovations aim to optimize outcomes for patients and providers alike. However, they also present challenges-ranging from ethical dilemmas to implementation barriers-that must be addressed to realize their full potential. This editorial integrates findings from ten influential studies that explore various facets of healthcare innovation, offering a comprehensive view of the advancements and challenges in the field. These studies reflect the dynamic interplay of technology, ethics, policy, and patient-centric design in creating resilient and sustainable healthcare systems.The work of Bossenko, Randmaa, Piho and Ross (Bossenko, 2024) emphasizes the foundational role of semantic interoperability in enabling efficient healthcare delivery and secondary data use. Tools developed for transforming health data formats, such as the transition from CDA to FHIR in Estonia, exemplify the potential of reusable, domain-expert-friendly solutions to address interoperability challenges. Similarly, Bregonzio, Bernasconi and Pinoli's work (Bregonzio, 2024) on FAIRification and data fusion within distributed analytics platforms highlights the importance of creating scalable, reusable, and interoperable data infrastructures. Together, these contributions underline the significance of harmonized data frameworks in driving global healthcare innovation.Ahmed, Constantinidou and Chatzifotis (Ahmed, 2023) systematic review examines ethical concerns surrounding precision medicine, emphasizing the patient perspective. Key themes include privacy, economic impacts, informed consent, and the risk of discrimination. Addressing these ethical issues requires proactive patient education, research, and policy reforms to build trust and mitigate risks.These findings complement the recommendations by Kurihara et al. (Kurihara, 2024), who advocates for a data-driven, participant-centered approach in research ethics, reinforcing the value of dynamic consent and open science practices in fostering inclusivity and transparency.Khalil's and their co-authors exploration of cloud-based regulatory platforms (Khalil, 2023) underscores their potential to revolutionize drug development by expediting the review process and enhancing global accessibility. However, realizing this potential requires concerted policy efforts and technological readiness. Sturmberg's and co-authors critique of reductionist research methodologies (Sturmberg, 2024) highlights the need for ecosystemic approaches to clinical decision-making, emphasizing the integration of complex, multi-level health determinants.Figueiredo's et al. work on Living Labs showcases the value of end-user engagement in designing dementia care solutions (Figueiredo, 2024). By addressing challenges such as sustainability and scalability, her proposed guidelines aim to maximize the impact of these collaborative innovation methods. Carriazo's et al. analysis of the Andalusian digital health strategies further illustrates the power of Quadruple Helix collaboration in driving health improvements through ecosystemic approaches (Carriazo, 2024).Laleci Erturkmen (Laleci Erturkmen, 2024) and Katehakis (Katehakis, 2024) focus on the European Health Data Space (EHDS) initiative and the smartHEALTH European Digital Innovation Hub, respectively. Their work underscores the importance of harmonized data standards and interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing precision medicine and AI-driven healthcare services. These initiatives highlight the potential of unified data ecosystems to enhance global clinical research and improve patient outcomes.The synthesis of these studies reveals a shared vision for the future of healthcare: one that leverages technology and innovation to improve patient outcomes, empower stakeholders, and address ethical and systemic challenges. Achieving this vision requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, integrating the principles of semantic interoperability, precision medicine, and ecosystemic innovation. By prioritizing ethical considerations and fostering global partnerships, the healthcare community can ensure a sustainable and equitable future for all.","A. Koumpis, Panagiotis D.

Deep learning approaches for resolving genomic discrepancies in cancer: a systematic review and clinical perspective,"Abstract Discrepancies in cancer sequencing data continue to pose significant challenges for accurate mutation detection, potentially resulting in misdiagnoses and suboptimal treatment strategies. Although deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach for identifying and rectifying these errors, there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation of DL architectures, performance benchmarks, and clinical translation. In this systematic review of 78 studies (2015–2024), We synthesize recent advancements in DL methodologies for identifying genomic discrepancies, demonstrating that convolutional and graph-based architectures currently achieve state-of-the-art performance in variant calling and tumor stratification. DL models reduce false-negative rates by 30%–40% compared to traditional pipelines, with methods such as MAGPIE prioritizing pathogenic variants with 92% accuracy. However, challenges such as data scarcity, batch effects, and the interpretability of “black-box” models persist. We propose a future research roadmap advocating federated learning to enhance data privacy and attention mechanisms to improve model transparency.

Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures, have shown unprecedented potential in addressing various blockchain challenges. However, a systematic review of Trans-former applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain, we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations, and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology.

This paper provides a systematic review of state-of-the-art AND techniques based on deep learning within the timeframe 2016-2024, filling a gap in existing literature. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using Google Scholar with keywords ""author name disambiguation"" + ""deep learning"" and temporal filters. The search yielded 52 documents, of which 28 were selected after full-text assessment. We categorized approaches based on learning paradigms: supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid methods. Additionally, we performed bibliometric analysis using OpenCitations data with network visualization via Gephi. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies employing deep learning for AND. The analysis of the comparable studies reveals that hybrid approaches achieve the best performance, with the top-performing method reaching 89.7 F1-score on AMiner datasets. Supervised methods predominantly focus on author assignment tasks, while unsupervised approaches excel at author grouping. Conclusion: Deep learning methods have significantly impacted AND by enabling integration of structured and unstructured data. Hybrid approaches effectively balance supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating superior performance. However, heavy reliance on AMiner datasets and lack of standardized evaluation frameworks remain critical challenges for the field’s advancement.","Francesca Cappelli, Giovanni Colavizza, Silvio Peroni",10.1007/s00799-025-00428-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00799-025-00428-6,International Journal on Digital Libraries,1,2025,yes,"The paper is clearly focused on academic literature, specifically dealing with author name disambiguation in digital libraries and analyzing academic publications.",yes,The paper explicitly mentions performing bibliometric analysis using OpenCitations data and includes network visualization via Gephi.,yes,"The paper goes well beyond basic database management, focusing on deep learning approaches for author name disambiguation.",maybe,"While the paper deals with structured and unstructured data integration, it doesn't explicitly mention knowledge graphs or semantic analysis.",yes,"The paper is centrally focused on deep learning applications for academic literature analysis, specifically for author name disambiguation.",maybe,"While the paper discusses author identification, it doesn't explicitly focus on paper discovery or recommendation algorithms.",yes,"This is a systematic review with detailed technical analysis, including performance metrics (F1-scores) and methodological comparisons.",maybe,"While the paper discusses technical approaches, it doesn't specifically focus on technical architectures for literature review assistance systems.",Include,"A systematic review of deep learning techniques for author name disambiguation demonstrates strong alignment with academic literature analysis, bibliometric methods, and machine learning applications.

Design Application and Evolution of 3D Visualization Technology in Architectural Heritage Conservation: A CiteSpace-Based Knowledge Mapping and Systematic Review (2005–2024),"This study integrates quantitative scientometric analysis with a qualitative systematic review to comprehensively examine the evolution, core research themes, and emerging trends of three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology in architectural heritage conservation from 2005 to 2024. A total of 813 relevant publications were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed using CiteSpace to construct a detailed knowledge map of the field. The findings highlight that foundational technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), photogrammetry, building information modeling (BIM), and heritage building information modeling (HBIM) have laid a solid technical foundation for accurate heritage documentation and semantic representation. At the same time, the integration of digital twins, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and immersive technologies has facilitated a shift from static documentation to dynamic perception, real-time analysis, and interactive engagement. The analysis identifies four major research domains: (1) 3D data acquisition and modeling techniques, (2) digital heritage documentation and information management, (3) virtual reconstruction and interactive visualization, and (4) digital transformation and cultural narrative integration. Based on these insights, this study proposes four key directions for future research: advancing intelligence and automation in 3D modeling workflows; enhancing cross-platform interoperability and semantic standardization; realizing the full lifecycle management of architectural heritage; and enhancing cultural narratives through digital expression. This study provides a systematic and in-depth understanding of the role of 3D visualization in architectural heritage conservation. It offers a solid theoretical foundation and strategic guidance for technological innovation, policy development, and interdisciplinary collaboration in the digital heritage field.","Jingyi Wang, S.

Deep learning in acupuncture: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES
The systematic review aimed to comprehensively summarize evidence from the existing literature on using deep learning (DL) techniques in the practice of acupuncture.
METHODS
Two reviewers conducted a thorough search of electronic databases, screened articles, and extracted data independently. Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, CQVIP, and SinoMed were searched from 2010 to 1 August 2025. Information of the included studies, including year of publication, tasks, models, data sources, dataset size, process, main outcomes, main findings, and limitations was extracted and synthesized qualitatively.
RESULTS
A total of 27 studies were included in this systematic review. The application tasks of DL models include acupoint location detection (n = 15), acupuncture manipulation analysis and classification (n = 4), disease management classification and prediction (n = 5), as well as acupuncture treatment monitoring (n = 3). All studies used self-built datasets based on public databases or self-collected datasets. The studies utilized a wide range of performance metrics, including offset error threshold, normalized mean error, mean Average Precision, Frames Per Second, Percentage of Correct Key Points, and Intersection over Union. Small data size and model inaccuracy were the two main limitations mentioned in the included studies.
CONCLUSION
The findings showcased the potential of DL models (CNN, RNN, LSTM, BERT, FNN, and YOLO variants) in detecting acupoint locations, analyzing and classifying acupuncture techniques, classifying and predicting disease management, as well as monitoring acupuncture treatment. While early applications focus primarily on standardization, newer systems demonstrate potential to enhance clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. Efforts should be directed toward addressing the challenges pertaining to data availability and model interpretability. Additionally, there is a need to establish quality appraisal tools for evaluating artificial intelligence studies.

Digital traceability in horticulture: a systematic review of edge-cloud-blockchain-terminal (ECBT) integration with IoT and AI technologies,"Global horticultural supply chains face escalating vulnerabilities from pathogenic outbreaks, climate disruptions, and regulatory demands. This systematic mini-review examines the Edge-Cloud-Blockchain-Terminal (ECBT) framework—an integrated architecture positioning blockchain as the trust backbone connecting distributed computing, edge intelligence, and user terminals—for comprehensive traceability. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 40 high-quality studies selected from 156 peer-reviewed articles retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases (2022–2025) using combined technology (“IoT” OR “blockchain” OR “AI” OR “edge computing”) and application (“traceability” OR “supply chain”) search terms. Technology coverage analysis revealed fragmented adoption: IoT dominates (45%, n = 18), followed by blockchain (32%, n = 13) and AI/ML (23%, n = 9), with only 3% achieving full ECBT integration despite demonstrated benefits. Blockchain implementations achieve 94.2% storage optimization through selective anchoring while maintaining cryptographic verification, with latency reduced by 73% through the CRPBFT consensus mechanism. While edge computing achieves a 65% reduction in latency, its integration with blockchain’s global state management presents persistent architectural challenges. Critical barriers persist: technical interoperability (23% metadata loss in cross-chain transitions), economic exclusion (42% of smallholder annual income for deployment), and scalability constraints (processing 47 million daily data points). The review identifies blockchain’s triple role as trust orchestrator, semantic preservator, and incentive aligner as key to overcoming the integration paradox. Future research should focus on agricultural-specific consensus, semantic interoperability, and inclusive deployment models to resolve the integration paradox.","Yan Huang, Xin Li, Luyi Xu, Yongqiang Ma",10.3389/fbloc.2025.1636627,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2025.1636627,Frontiers in Blockchain,1,2025,maybe,"The paper is a systematic review that specifically analyzes academic literature, using PRISMA guidelines and searching academic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore).

Retrieving and discovering new knowledge from documents' abstracts in scientific databases: Proposing a query-based abstractive summarization model,"Current search engines for Knowledge Retrieval (KR) and Knowledge Discovery (KD) do not effectively utilize scientifically validated documents, especially those indexed in scientific databases. Scientific databases e.g., Scopus primarily consist of document-based content and provide documents' abstract. Their Information Retrieval (IR) system only perform document searches and lack the capability to extract and discover new knowledge from documents' abstract in these databases and responding to users’ queries. The aim is to introduce a model that can efficiently perform these tasks. The statistical population for this study encompasses all scientific databases, with a particular emphasis on Scopus. To clarify the process of KR and KD as we define it, we employed a systematic review and meta-analysis framework using 33 queries. We conducted the identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion steps following the PRISMA protocol. Next, we performed extraction, labeling, grouping, analysis, and inference. The outcome of these processes provided us with novel insights, which contribute to our exploratory knowledge. To automate these processes, we have proposed a conceptual model from query-based indirect abstractive summarization approach. The outcomes of this research offer fresh insights to database designers, administrators, and researchers, enabling the development of tools for KR and KD within these invaluable knowledge repositories. The integration of such tools into scientific databases will enhance user access to scientific knowledge to meet their informational and research needs.","Neda Abbasi Dashtaki, Mozafar CheshmehSohrabi, Mitra Pashootanizadeh, Hamidreza Baradaran Kashani",10.1016/j.jjimei.2025.100366,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjimei.2025.100366,Int.

"A Bibliometric and Systematic Review of Manufacturing-as-a-Service: Literature Insights, Challenges, and Future Trends","Manufacturing-as-a-service consists of an Industry 4.0 innovation and has been a focal point of research and business attention in recent years. MaaS provides a matching connection between manufacturing resources or capabilities as service and organizations that need to utilize them, via a digital thread. Through this approach, not all companies have to invest in heavy capital, which allows them to focus on other critical capacities. This review provides bibliometric insights, such as quantitative results regarding the annual trends, dominant publications, journals, institutions, and VOS-viewer-software-extracted networks that highlight co-occurrence of keywords and journal co-citations. Moreover, the publications are presented concisely and are critically evaluated and categorized in pilar categories based on their core concept. The current limitations and future trends in the MaaS field are identified as well. Even though it is an established, important Industry 4.0 innovation, the available literature may not provide such a holistic, comprehensive overview of MaaS. The current study not only presents critical observations of contemporary and distinguished scientific papers but also guides researchers in a systematic examination of MaaS theoretically, architecturally represented, or regarding its data-driven opportunities.","Anastasia Karamanli, Alexandros Xanthopoulos, A.

Recent Advances in DL-based Text Summarization: A Systematic Review,"The technique of creating a brief and relevant summary of a lengthy piece of text while retaining its vital content and overall relevance is known as text summarization. It involves condensing the original text while retaining its core message. In today's age of information overload, text summarization has gained immense significance as we encounter an excessive amount of textual information on a daily basis. Text summarization can be done manually by humans, but it can also be automated using ML techniques. DL models have demonstrated promising results in text summarization in recent years, and have become a major study area in the field of NLP. This study offers a synopsis of literature on the use of DL approaches for text summarization. The review covers various techniques such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, DeepSum, GA2C, Pointer Generator, and BERT, as well as various datasets such as CNN/Daily Mail and Arabic datasets. The ROUGE Score was used to assess the efficacy of text summarizing approaches, and BERT received the highest score of 98%.

Road Traffic Accident Prediction Based on Multi-Source Data – A Systematic Review,"With the acceleration of urbanisation and the rapid increase in road traffic volume, the scientific prediction of traffic accidents has become crucial for improving road safety and enhancing traffic efficiency. However, traffic accident prediction is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires the comprehensive consideration of multiple factors, including people, vehicles, roads and the environment. This paper provides a detailed analysis of traffic accident prediction based on multi-source data. By thoroughly considering data sources, data processing and prediction methods, this paper introduces the various aspects of traffic accident prediction from different perspectives. It helps readers understand the characteristics of different data and methods, the process of accident prediction and the key technologies involved. At the end of the paper, the main challenges and future directions in road crash prediction research are summarised. For example, the lack of efficient data sharing between different departments and fields poses significant challenges to the integration of multi-source data. In the future, combining deep learning models with time-sensitive data, such as social media and vehicle network data, could effectively improve the accuracy of real-time accident prediction.","Meiling He, Guangrong Meng, Xiaohui Wu, Xun Han, Jiangyang Fan",10.7307/ptt.v37i2.763,https://doi.org/10.7307/ptt.v37i2.763,Promet - Traffic&amp;Transportation,1,2025,no,"The paper does not focus on academic literature analysis, but instead focuses on traffic accident prediction using multi-source data.",no,There is no mention of citation analysis or bibliometric methods in the paper.

Systematic Review of Computer Vision Semantic Analysis in Socially Assistive Robotics,"The simultaneous surges in the research on socially assistive robotics and that on computer vision can be seen as a result of the shifting and increasing necessities of our global population, especially towards social care with the expanding population in need of socially assistive robotics. The merging of these fields creates demand for more complex and autonomous solutions, often struggling with the lack of contextual understanding of tasks that semantic analysis can provide and hardware limitations. Solving those issues can provide more comfortable and safer environments for the individuals in most need. This work aimed to understand the current scope of science in the merging fields of computer vision and semantic analysis in lightweight models for robotic assistance. Therefore, we present a systematic review of visual semantics works concerned with assistive robotics. Furthermore, we discuss the trends and possible research gaps in those fields. We detail our research protocol, present the state of the art and future trends, and answer five pertinent research questions. Out of 459 articles, 22 works matching the defined scope were selected, rated in 8 quality criteria relevant to our search, and discussed in depth. Our results point to an emerging field of research with challenging gaps to be explored by the academic community. Data on database study collection, year of publishing, and the discussion of methods and datasets are displayed. We observe that the current methods regarding visual semantic analysis show two main trends. At first, there is an abstraction of contextual data to enable an automated understanding of tasks.

"A review on method entities in the academic literature: extraction, evaluation, and application","In scientific research, the method is an indispensable means to solve scientific problems and a critical research object. With the advancement of sciences, many scientific methods are being proposed, modified, and used in academic literature. The authors describe details of the method in the abstract and body text, and key entities in academic literature reflecting names of the method are called method entities. Exploring diverse method entities in a tremendous amount of academic literature helps scholars understand existing methods, select the appropriate method for research tasks, and propose new methods. Furthermore, the evolution of method entities can reveal the development of a discipline and facilitate knowledge discovery. Therefore, this article offers a systematic review of methodological and empirical works focusing on extracting method entities from full-text academic literature and efforting to build knowledge services using these extracted method entities. Definitions of key concepts involved in this review were first proposed. Based on these definitions, we systematically reviewed the approaches and indicators to extract and evaluate method entities, with a strong focus on the pros and cons of each approach. We also surveyed how extracted method entities were used to build new applications.

Multimodal approaches and AI-driven innovations in dementia diagnosis: a systematic review,"Abstract Neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia, present some of the most pressing challenges in the field of medicine today. By causing progressive cognitive and functional decline, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) subtypes are an essential area for urgently needed work. As a systematic literature review, this paper outlines the intricacies of dementia’s pathophysiology of dementia by addressing the complexity of dementia as a construct, how different types of clinical paths can happen, how neuronal atrophy occurs along different cerebral domains, and when the critical diagnostic thresholds are met. A complete review of peer-reviewed papers over the past ten years, with a focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and multimodal fusion approaches to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic precision will focus on neuroimaging biomarkers, EEG-based cognitive profiles, digital phenotyping, and wearable sensor analytics. This survey will compare the study’s algorithms or frameworks on sensitivity, specificity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and clinical transnationality concerning early detection and monitoring progression. Though AI methods are having a continuing rapid surge in progress, the issues of model transparency and generalizability are still lacking, thus meaning the need for XAI. This work builds a multi-disciplinary data agnostic approach for building stronger patient-centered models that can bring together genomics, imaging, behavior and contextual features in the task-driven processes.

Knowledge Tracing: A Review of Available Technologies,"As a student modeling technique, knowledge tracing is widely used by various intelligent tutoring systems to infer and trace the individual’s knowledge state during the learning process. In recent years, various models were proposed to get accurate and easy-to-interpret results. To make sense of the wide Knowledge tracing (KT) modeling landscape, this paper conducts a systematic review to provide a detailed and nuanced discussion of relevant KT techniques from the perspective of assumptions, data, and algorithms. The results show that most existing KT models consider only a fragment of the assumptions that relate to the knowledge components within items and student’s cognitive process. Almost all types of KT models take “quize data” as input, although it is insufficient to reflect a clear picture of students’ learning process.

Total Recall via Keyqueries: A Case Study for Systematic Reviews,"Researchers conduct systematic reviews to gain and build a comprehensive un-derstanding of a studied (cid:28)eld. During the screening of documents, researchers aim for total recall to ensure that all relevant documents are covered in their systematic review. Creating a systematic review is time-consuming and can take several years. Systems for technology-assisted systematic reviews incorpo-rate user feedback, whether a document was relevant or not, to learn presenting more yet unknown potential relevant documents. We propose a system that automatically creates so-called keyqueries which rank the known relevant documents in the top results of a reference search engine. This keyquery approach is motivated by research on related work search, where keyqueries retrieve additional related work for a given set of documents. Therefore, we construct keyqueries for the documents labeled as relevant in the systematic review to identify new, potentially relevant documents. We compare our keyquery-based approach with four classical machine-learning approaches and the state-of-the-art approach on three simulated systematic reviews with biological research topics. The Evaluation shows that our keyquery-based approach outperforms our implementation of logistic regression and decision table, and is comparable to a random forest approach.

Leveraging Advanced Technologies for (Smart) Transportation Planning: A Systematic Review,"Transportation systems worldwide are facing numerous challenges, including congestion, environmental impacts, and safety concerns. This study used a systematic literature review to investigate how advanced technologies (e.g., IoT, AI, digital twins, and optimization methods) support smart transportation planning. Specifically, this study examines the interrelationships between transportation challenges, proposed solutions, and enabling technologies, providing insights into how these innovations support smart mobility initiatives. A systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 peer-reviewed articles published between 2013 and 2024, including studies that examined smart transportation technologies. To quantitatively assess relationships among key concepts, a Sentence BERT-based natural language processing approach was employed to compute alignment scores between transportation challenges, technological solutions, and implementation strategies. The findings highlight the fact that real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and digital twin simulations significantly enhance traffic flow, safety, and operational efficiency while mitigating environmental impacts. The analysis further reveals strong correlations between traffic congestion and public transit optimization, reinforcing the effectiveness of integrated, data-driven strategies. Additionally, IoT-based sensor networks and AI-driven decision-support systems are shown to play a critical role in sustainable urban mobility by enabling proactive congestion management, multimodal transportation planning, and emission reduction strategies. From a policy perspective, this study underscores the need for investment in urban-scale data infrastructures, the integration of digital twin modeling into long-term planning frameworks, and the alignment of optimization tools with public transit improvements to foster equitable and efficient mobility.

Artificial Intelligence Technology for Path Planning of Automated Earthwork Machinery,"The challenging characteristics of earthwork environments—complex, unstructured, and constantly evolving—pose significant challenges for the path planning of automated earthwork machinery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have opened new avenues to address these challenges, which are crucial for improving the intelligence level of automated earthwork machinery. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive analyses on AI‐based path planning in earthwork operations. Consequently, we provide a systematic review of four AI technologies currently employed in path planning for earthwork machinery, including (1) evolutionary computation, (2) swarm intelligence, (3) machine learning, and (4) other AI‐based technologies. We analyzed the application and performance evaluation results of these technologies across various construction machinery. Through this systematic analysis, we identified several key challenges: (1) multiconstraint earthwork environments, (2) generalization across 3D unstructured sites, (3) adaptability to dynamically uncertain environments, and (4) shortage of on‐site validation. We then outline potential future directions: (1) integration of generative AI with reinforcement learning, (2) use of large model technology, (3) adoption of embodied intelligence technology, and (4) conduction of more on‐site experiments.","Cheng Zhou, Yuxiang Wang, Rao Li, Tao Guan, Zhenyuan Liu, Gang Peng, Ke You",10.1002/rob.22479,https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.22479,Journal of Field Robotics,5,2024,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis, but rather on a systematic review of AI technologies for path planning in earthwork machinery.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence and BIM in Construction: Systematic Review and Quantitative Comparative Analysis,"In the transition toward a more digital and data-driven construction industry, understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) are integrated is key to planning, delivering, and operating projects effectively. This review examines recent studies to identify usage patterns of AI and BIM. Searches were conducted on the Web of Science Core Collection from 2022 to 2025. After running a reproducible review protocol aligned with PRISMA 2020, which began with 1212 articles, and after a funneling process, 12 studies met the predefined eligibility criteria. In the present study, the synthesis was non-meta-analytic; instead, the information was analyzed by using standardized tabulation with a consistent format and compared using a two-level weighting scheme. The methodological approach combines full-text reading and descriptive coding with a reproducible weighting scheme that accounts for mentions per study and integrates them at the corpus level using open-source tools. The results show a strong focus on Deep Learning (DL), with a greater presence in Digital Twins (DT) and BIM Modeling (BIMM); Multidimensional BIM (4D/5D) appears as a secondary line, while the Common Data Environment (CDE) and Clash detection (CD) are sporadic. The coupling of DL-DT and DL-BIMM predominates. Simultaneously, Machine Learning (ML) provides explainable analysis on structured data, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) act as enablers for data generation/adaptation and deployment with traceability. It is concluded that advancing metrics and shared datasets, especially for CDE and CD, along with developing reproducible workflows oriented toward MLOps, are key to scaling AI in real-world environments.","Reinaldo Valdebenito, Eric Forcael",10.3390/app152312470,https://doi.org/10.3390/app152312470,Applied Sciences,0,2025,yes,"The paper clearly focuses on academic literature, specifically conducting a systematic review of studies from Web of Science Core Collection.",maybe,"While the paper uses systematic review methodology, it doesn't explicitly focus on citation analysis or bibliometric methods for identifying core papers.

Towards semantic-driven boolean query formalization for biomedical systematic literature reviews,"OBJECTIVE
Study identification refers to formalizing an effective search over biomedical databases for retrieving all eligible evidence for a systematic review. Manual construction of queries, where a user submit a search query for which a biomedical search system such as PubMed would identify the most relevant documents, has been recognized as a very costly step in conducting systematic reviews. The objective of this paper is to present an automatic query generation approach to reduce the time and labor cost of manual biomedical study identification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The evaluation benchmark is the widely adopted CLEF 2018 Technology Assisted Reviews (TAR) collection, with 72 systematic reviews on Diagnosis Test Accuracy. We use and fine-tune pre-trained language models for generating high-level key-phrases and their dense embeddings. We constructed and published a dataset consists of almost one million PubMed articles' abstracts and their keywords for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. We also use concepts that are represented in the Unified Medical Language System, UMLS, for query expansion and embedding generation. We exploit and test different clustering methods, namely Agglomerative clustering, Affinity Propagation, and K-Means, over the generated embeddings to form query clauses.
RESULTS
Our proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art automatic query generation models across Precision (0.0821 compared with 0.005), Recall (0.9676 compared with 0.878), and F-measures (0.2898 compared with 0.0356 in F3 measure). In addition, some of the proposed methods can even outperform the performance of the manually crafted queries in some specific measures.
CONCLUSION
The proposed model in this paper can be utilized to form an effective initial search query that can be further refined and updated by human reviewers for achieving the desired performance. For future work, we would like to explore the application of the presented query formalization methods in existing study identification methodologies and techniques, especially those that iteratively train machine learning models based on the domain experts' feedback on the relevancy of the retrieved studies.

The Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks in Architecture Design: A Systematic Review,"Purpose: To review and analyze the research status of the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the field of architecture design. Methods: This study followed the latest PRISMA guidelines and systematically collected relevant research literature from domestic and international sources. In-depth analysis was conducted on 95 representative Chinese and English language articles. During the analysis process, three dimensions of intelligent architectural generation methods were comprehensively and deeply explored: the data application scale, algorithm type, and architectural design process. Results: (1) GANs have been applied to various processes in architectural design practice, from design generation, development, and evaluation to final solution expression; (2) GANs can be applied at different architectural scales, ranging from large-scale complex functional buildings to refined layout designs of residential units; (3) the appearance of GANs enables designers to quickly present design results at various stages, greatly improving work efficiency; and (4) at present, GANs also have many shortcomings, mainly reflected in the accuracy of the data and the usability of tools. Conclusion: Improvements in computer performance and the enrichment of data resources have promoted the widespread application of intelligent architectural generation methods.

A Systematic Review on Automatic Insect Detection Using Deep Learning,"Globally, insect pests are the primary reason for reduced crop yield and quality. Although pesticides are commonly used to control and eliminate these pests, they can have adverse effects on the environment, human health, and natural resources. As an alternative, integrated pest management has been devised to enhance insect pest control, decrease the excessive use of pesticides, and enhance the output and quality of crops. With the improvements in artificial intelligence technologies, several applications have emerged in the agricultural context, including automatic detection, monitoring, and identification of insects. The purpose of this article is to outline the leading techniques for the automated detection of insects, highlighting the most successful approaches and methodologies while also drawing attention to the remaining challenges and gaps in this area. The aim is to furnish the reader with an overview of the major developments in this field. This study analysed 92 studies published between 2016 and 2022 on the automatic detection of insects in traps using deep learning techniques. The search was conducted on six electronic databases, and 36 articles met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were studies that applied deep learning techniques for insect classification, counting, and detection, written in English. The selection process involved analysing the title, keywords, and abstract of each study, resulting in the exclusion of 33 articles. The remaining 36 articles included 12 for the classification task and 24 for the detection task. Two main approaches—standard and adaptable—for insect detection were identified, with various architectures and detectors. The accuracy of the classification was found to be most influenced by dataset size, while detection was significantly affected by the number of classes and dataset size. The study also highlights two challenges and recommendations, namely, dataset characteristics (such as unbalanced classes and incomplete annotation) and methodologies (such as the limitations of algorithms for small objects and the lack of information about small insects). To overcome these challenges, further research is recommended to improve insect pest management practices. This research should focus on addressing the limitations and challenges identified in this article to ensure more effective insect pest management.","A. Teixeira, José Ribeiro, R. Morais, J.

Systematic Review on Identification and Prediction of Deep Learning-Based Cyber Security Technology and Convergence Fields,"Recently, as core technologies leading the fourth industrial revolution, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, the cloud, and big data, have promoted smart convergence across national socio-economic infrastructures, cyber systems are expanding and becoming complex, and they are not effective in responding to cyber safety risks and threats using security technology solutions limited to a single system. Therefore, we developed cyber security technology that combines machine learning and AI technology to solve complex problems related to cyber safety. In this regard, this study aims to identify technology development trends to prevent the risks and threats of various cyber systems by monitoring major cyber security convergence fields and technologies through the symmetrical thesis and patent analysis. Because thesis information can explain the superiority of technology and patent information can explain the usefulness of a technology, they can be effectively used for analyzing and predicting technology development trends. Therefore, in this study, latent Dirichlet allocation is applied to extract text-document-based technical topics for the symmetrical thesis and patent information to identify security convergence fields and technologies for cyber safety. In addition, it elucidates cyber security convergence fields and technology trends by applying a dynamic topic model and long short-term memory, which are useful for analyzing technological changes and predicting trends. Based on these results, cyber security administrators, system operators, and developers can effectively identify and respond to trends in related technologies to reduce threats, and companies and experts developing cyber security solutions can present a new security approach.","Seung-Yeon Hwang, Dong-Jin Shin, Jeong-Joon Kim",10.3390/sym14040683,https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14040683,Symmetry,12,2022,yes,The paper explicitly focuses on analyzing academic literature (theses) alongside patents for technology trend analysis.,maybe,"While the paper analyzes academic literature, it doesn't specifically mention citation analysis or traditional bibliometric methods.

"A systematic review of the literature on intellectual capital management, technology and innovation","Research background: Since no previous work was found to cover a general assessment of the
literature on the relationship between intellectual capital management, technology and
innovation, this study undertook a general review of the articles dedicated to the aforementioned
relationships. As demonstrated by the academic literature, organizational knowledge and
innovation are grounded on intellectual capital. In the past two decades, and more so during the
Covid-19 pandemic, economy and society have become deeply reliant on technology, and
specifically on digital information systems. It is therefore of utmost scientific interest to assess
the knowledge regarding the relationships between intellectual capital management, technology
and innovation, with the view to revealing the overall significant findings on these topics.
Purpose of the article: This paper provides a first comprehensive analysis of the empirical
research covering the integrated studies on intellectual capital management, technology and
innovation, unveiling its extent, focus, gaps and trends, for the gain of future research.
Methods: With the aim to investigate the empirical academic papers dedicated to the relationship
between the concepts of intellectual capital, technology and innovation, a systematic literature
review has been conducted, covering all the articles published by the end of April 2022. In the
end, based on the review protocol, 37 works have been selected and further examined.
Findings & Value added: The findings of the analysis on the core body of work in the field
confirm the empirically proven significant relationships that exist between technological
orientation, intellectual capital management, and innovation performance. It is envisaged that
post-pandemic studies will cover under-researched areas such as the relationship between
technology, intellectual capital and innovation in specific industries and sectors e.g. healthcare
and pharma, or in novel business models, and the impact of advanced technologies on knowledge
acquisition and management. This study facilitates future research orientation by unveiling the literature focus so far, as well as the research gaps.

A Review on “Integration of Building Information Modeling [BIM]”,"The integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) into construction and infrastructure projects has revolutionized the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries. BIM enables digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a building, improving project efficiency, collaboration, and decision-making. This paper explores the integration of BIM with various technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Blockchain to enhance project planning, cost estimation, risk management, and sustainability. The challenges of BIM integration, including interoperability, data security, and adoption barriers, are also discussed. A systematic review of existing literature highlights best practices and emerging trends in BIM implementation. The findings suggest that adopting BIM-integrated approaches can significantly improve project outcomes, reduce errors, and enhance sustainability in construction. Future research should focus on advanced automation, real-time data analytics, and regulatory frameworks to maximize BIM's potential. The integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) has been identified as a promising but challenging topic to transform information towards the generation of knowledge and intelligence. Achievement of integrating these two concepts and enabling technologies will have a significant impact on solving problems in the civil, building and infrastructure sectors. However, since GIS and BIM were originally developed for different purposes, numerous challenges are being encountered for the integration. To better understand these two different domains, this paper reviews the development and dissimilarities of GIS and BIM, the existing integration methods, and investigates their potential in various applications. This study shows that the integration methods are developed for various reasons and aim to solve different problems. The parameters influencing the choice can be summarized and named as “EEEF” criteria: effectiveness, extensibility, effort, and flexibility. Compared with other methods, semantic web technologies provide a promising and generalized integration solution. However, the biggest challenges of this method are the large efforts required at early stage and the isolated development of ontologies within one particular domain. The isolation problem also applies to other methods. Therefore, openness is the key of the success of BIM and GIS integration","Arbaz Lone, Shilpa Chauhan",10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i05.58285,https://doi.org/10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i05.58285,International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research,0,2025,no,"The paper is not focused on analyzing academic literature itself, but rather on the technical integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).",no,The paper does not mention any citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

Harnessing precision and innovation: A systematic review of precision livestock farming and IoT technologies in the Philippines,"Due to the advent of precision livestock farming with modern technology called the Internet of Things (IoT), there has been a revolution in the agriculture sector that aims to increase productivity and sustainability while sustaining animal welfare. Within the Philippine context, where smallholder farming communities predominate, adopting these advanced techniques holds immense potential to improve resource utilization, optimize production processes, and empower rural livelihoods. This research is a systematic literature review that considers the pros and cons of the applications of digital technology and precision livestock farming in the Philippines. The review synthesizes existing research to identify the key advancements, challenges, and opportunities within this domain, addressing the overarching question: What is the current state of implementation and adoption of precision livestock farming and IoT applications in the Philippines, and what are the associated technical, socio-economic, and policy-related barriers and facilitators? The study employed a thorough systematic search strategy, wherein the publications from inception to March 2024 were published in various databases. The review forms the basis of both quantitative and qualitative studies, accompanied by an investigation into conceptual and empirical research exploring various livestock industries, such as poultry, swine, dairy, and meat processing. The findings reveal significant advancements in monitoring and management systems, egg and incubation management, animal health and welfare, supply chain and logistics, and environmental monitoring. Therefore, the review indicates that research success largely depends on collaborative actions initiated by stakeholders, i.e., researchers, technology providers, policymakers, and farmers in particular. Developing affordable and user-friendly technological solutions, strengthening rural infrastructure, enhancing farmers’ digital skills, and implementing supportive government policies and incentives are essential for fostering the widespread adoption of these innovative practices.","A.

"A Survey on UAV Applications in Smart City Management: Challenges, Advances, and Opportunities","Smart management of urban space is an important way to achieve the goal of sustainable urban development. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in urban space management work and have greatly improved the level of it. UAV technology assisting urban space management involves many technical details and has generated a number of problems. Therefore, a systematic review of the applications of UAVs in urban spatial management work is very necessary and can provide a comprehensive reference for relevant researchers. This is conducive to the generation of more new insights, methods, and applications. However, according to our research, there is a lack of relevant systematic investigation. We screened and researched a large number of relevant literature works (about 230) with the help of search tools, such as Web of Science and IEEE Xplore, and combined with our own working experience to review and summarize the field in an all-round way. Taking the definition, needs, and challenges of urban spatial management as an entry point, this article systematically summarizes the task flow, working paradigm, technical system, and application direction of UAV-assisted urban spatial management. It also takes our recently developed UAV urban management system as an example to provide an introduction on how to integrate advanced technologies such as UAV and artificial intelligence. Finally, this article summarizes several concluding findings and proposes several future research directions. The research in this article shows that UAV technology has already played a great role in urban spatial management work, but it is still far from realizing automation and intelligence, and it needs to continue to make efforts in terms of methods, systems, applications, and policies. In order to achieve these goals, UAV technology can be further integrated with advanced technologies such as deep learning, more types of UAV industry applications can be carried out, a more functional unmanned aircraft system can be developed, and better management policies can be formulated.","Haoran Xu, Lizhe Wang, Wei Han, Yixin Yang, Jiabao Li, Yue Lu, Jun Yu Li",10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3317500,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3317500,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,31,2023,no,"The paper discusses a systematic review of academic literature, specifically mentioning using Web of Science and IEEE Xplore databases.

"Digital Revolution in Medical Pathology: Integrating Ai, Genomics, and Molecular Imaging","The current clinical pathologic diagnostic process using histological slide evaluation demonstrates inconsistent accuracy in medical diagnosis. Progress in digital pathology and other modern technologies now enables the utilization of AI for medical image diagnostics, along with genomic technology for profile assessment and molecular image functionality. This systematic review examines the impact of artificial intelligence technology combined with genomic analysis and molecular imaging systems on present-day pathological medicine advancement. The review includes research published between 2014 and 2025, obtained from the top five databases, to demonstrate how each technology improves diagnosis separately and collaborates for precise medicine advancement. The analysis evaluated ten studies that matched all the established criteria for inclusion. Medical diagnostics benefit from combined system platforms, which also strengthen patient classification systems and treatment selection. However, these platforms require improvements in data standards and workflow connections, as well as computational resources and moral framework requirements. The study defines the necessary criteria for government-connected data platforms and interpretive artificial intelligence models, and then creates regulatory mechanisms in collaboration with interdisciplinary partnerships to develop safe and equitable healthcare applications. A single organized system triggers an essential transformation that shifts pathology from traditional morphological practices toward complex multivariate modern data methods. The research delivers strategic recommendations to enhance future practice and policy development, which will enable these technologies to be widely used in clinical settings.","Adeyemi Sarah Halleluyah, Sodiq Balogun, Abraham Chibuikem Ikeji, B.

Recommendation Systems: A Systematic Review,"This article presents a comprehensive and objective systematic review of existing research on recommendation systems with regards to core theory, latest studies, various applications, current attitudes, and potential future applications. The research is mainly based on exploring professional peer-reviewed studies and articles and using their abstracts to create a comprehensive and unbiased review of existing research. The following search terms were used to identify articles and studies for the research: recommendation systems; recommender systems; core theory of recommender systems; current attitudes towards recommendation systems; latest studies on recommendation systems; applications of recommendation systems; potential studies on recommendation systems; and future potential applications of recommendation systems. The research also used the advanced search filter to locate recent studies for comparison by limiting the search by year to find studies published from 2021 onwards. Most literature on this area highlights the importance of recommendation systems in almost all aspects of modern life. Specifically, recommendation systems have become critical components in business, health care, education, marketing, and social networking domains. Additionally, most studies identified reinforcement of learning and deep learning techniques as significant developments in the field. These techniques form the backbone of most modern recommendation systems. The primary concern that could hinder further evolution systems is their consequent filter bubble effects which many studies showed to be problematic. Healthcare is a central area that shows tremendous potential for these systems. Although recommender systems have been implemented in this domain, there remains a lot of untapped potential that, if unleashed, could revolutionize medicine and healthcare. But the problems facing these systems have to be tackled first to establish trust.

Integrating Advanced Sensor Fusion with User-Centered Design and Rapid Prototyping in Robotics: A Comprehensive Review,"The integration of multi-modal sensor fusion with user-centered design principles and rapid prototyping methodologies
has emerged as a transformative approach in modern robotics. This systematic review analyzes the evolution and current
state of sensor fusion approaches in robotics from 2004 to 2023, examining 15 seminal papers that have shaped the
field’s development. Through careful analysis of both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, we trace
the progression from traditional probabilistic methods to contemporary deep learning approaches. Our review reveals
three major trends that have shaped the field: the transition from simple two-sensor integration to sophisticated multi-
modal architectures, the emergence of end-to-end learning approaches that unify feature extraction and fusion processes,
and the growing emphasis on user-centered design and rapid prototyping in real-world applications. While deep learning
methods have advanced the state-of-the-art in tasks such as multi-modal perception and real-time sensor calibration, our
analysis reveals that hybrid approaches—which combine data-driven neural networks with traditional probabilistic
methods—achieve superior robustness and reliability. These hybrid systems particularly excel when integrated with
user-centered design principles, offering both high performance and practical usability. We identify several critical
challenges, including the need for standardized evaluation metrics, improved handling of sensor uncertainty, and more
efficient real-time processing architectures that can be rapidly prototyped and deployed. This review provides a
comprehensive framework for understanding the current capabilities and limitations of sensor fusion in robotics while
offering insights into future research directions that emphasize both technical advancement and practical usability.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AS SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION FOR THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR: FINDINGS FROM DEVELOPING ECONOMIES,". Agricultural production plays an important role both in national and global economies. The efficient and safe methods of sustainable agricultural production is crucial, and the use of information technology is imperative to meet this end. Among the available information technology tools, this study highlights the IT based cognitive solutions supported by the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for sustainable solutions in the agriculture sector of developing economies. For this purpose, a systematic review of 87 papers has been conducted in the chosen last 20 years from 2000 to 2019 to identify the major trends, challenges, limitations related to the applicability of AI-supported cognitive solutions in the agricultural industry of developing countries. The results derived from the extant literature represent some major flaws in the existing technological & cognitive solutions being used for agriculture means in the developing economies, with special emphasis on the lack of advanced AI techniques that are required for the development of robust and precise farming methods. This is due to the farmers' inability to use sustainable technological solutions that are limited by the high cost of available technological tools.

A Review of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography and Its Future Development Trends,"Extreme ultraviolet lithography, leveraging a radiation wavelength of 13.5 nm, has become a critical enabling technology for semiconductor fabrication at the 7 nm node and beyond. This paper provides a systematic review of the architectural evolution and development trajectory of EUV lithography, covering its progression from early experimental research in the 1990s to its industrial deployment by leading foundries. The study emphasizes two key performance bottlenecks—EUV light sources and optical systems that are decisive in determining throughput, pattern fidelity, and scalability. In terms of technical advances, this review summarizes recent research efforts to improve laser-to-plasma conversion efficiency, suppress debris contamination, enhance spectral purity, and integrate real-time source control. It also explores innovations in EUV mask design, high-numerical-aperture optical systems, and emerging flat optics technologies. EUV systems face several significant challenges despite continuous progress, including limited source power, thermally induced optical aberrations, and stochastic resist effects at sub-nanometer scales. This paper also discusses several potential solutions, such as free-electron lasers, machine learning-based aberration correction systems, and hybrid lithography strategies that integrate EUV with other patterning techniques. Furthermore, global collaborative initiatives and advancing domestic ecosystems strongly support sustained innovation in this field. By reviewing current progress and outlining future directions, this work aims to offer a comprehensive reference and inspire further exploration in EUV lithography research and industrial implementation.",Jinhui Lai,10.56028/aetr.14.1.1608.2025,https://doi.org/10.56028/aetr.14.1.1608.2025,Advances in Engineering Technology Research,0,2025,no,"The paper is not focused on academic literature analysis, but rather on technical developments in semiconductor manufacturing, specifically EUV lithography.",no,The paper does not mention or employ citation analysis or bibliometric methods.

Outdoor Thermal Comfort Research and Its Implications for Landscape Architecture: A Systematic Review,"Amid global warming and urbanization, outdoor thermal comfort has become a critical consideration in landscape architecture. This study integrates a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of 1417 empirical studies (1980–2024) sourced from Web of Science, aiming to clarify the current state of research, identify core themes, and propose future directions. This study examines key evaluation models, the influence of spatial morphology, and their practical applications using keyword co-occurrence, citation networks, and thematic analyses. Findings show a significant rise in research over the past decade, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Core themes include thermal comfort indices (PMV, PET, and UTCI), microclimate regulation, and important spatial indicators (height-to-width ratio, sky view factor, and greening). The field is increasingly shifting towards simulation tools (such as ENVI-met and CFD) rather than traditional field measurements, with artificial intelligence emerging as a tool for predictive and regulatory purposes, though its application remains limited. However, much of the research focuses on small-scale morphological optimization and lacks a systematic framework for spatial representation. Future research should prioritize developing a comprehensive evaluation system adaptable to diverse landscapes, investigating the interplay between spatial form and thermal comfort, and advancing sustainable, low-carbon design strategies. The insights from this study provide a solid foundation for improving outdoor thermal comfort and guiding sustainable urban development through landscape architecture.","Tingfeng Liu, Yaolong Wang, Longhao Zhang, Ninghan Xu, Fengliang Tang",10.3390/su17052330,https://doi.org/10.3390/su17052330,Sustainability,11,2025,yes,"The paper clearly focuses on academic literature, specifically analyzing 1417 empirical studies from Web of Science.",yes,"The paper explicitly mentions using ""keyword co-occurrence, citation networks, and thematic analyses"" as part of its bibliometric analysis.",maybe,"The paper goes beyond basic database management, incorporating bibliometric analysis methods and mentions AI applications, though this appears to be more about the field being studied rather than the analysis methods used.",maybe,"While the paper uses thematic analysis and citation networks, which are related to knowledge graph concepts, it doesn't explicitly mention knowledge graph construction.",maybe,The paper mentions AI applications but doesn't specifically detail using NLP/ML for the literature analysis itself.

The Application of Deep Learning for Lymph Node Segmentation: A Systematic Review,"Automatic lymph node segmentation is the cornerstone for advances in computer vision tasks for early detection and staging of cancer. Traditional segmentation methods are constrained by manual delineation and variability in operator proficiency, limiting their ability to achieve high accuracy. The introduction of deep learning technologies offers new possibilities for improving the accuracy of lymph node image analysis. This study evaluates the application of deep learning in lymph node segmentation and discusses the methodologies of various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, encoder-decoder networks, and transformers in analyzing medical imaging data across different modalities. Despite the advancements, it still confronts challenges like the shape diversity of lymph nodes, the scarcity of accurately labeled datasets, and the inadequate development of methods that are robust and generalizable across different imaging modalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in lymph node segmentation task. Furthermore, this study also explores potential future research directions, including multimodal fusion techniques, transfer learning, and the use of large-scale pre-trained models to overcome current limitations while enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment planning strategies.","Jingguo Qu, Xinyang Han, Man-Lik Chui, Yao Pu, Simon Takadiyi Gunda, Ziman Chen, Jing Qin, Ann Dorothy King, W.

A Comprehensive and Systematic Review for Deep Learning-Based De Novo Peptide Sequencing,"Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has revolutionized the field of proteomics, enabling the high-throughput identification of proteins. However, one of the central challenges in mass spectrometry-based proteomics remains peptide identification, especially in the absence of a comprehensive peptide database. While traditional database search methods compare observed mass spectra to pre-existing protein databases, they are limited by the availability and completeness of these databases. \emph{De novo} peptide sequencing, which derives peptide sequences directly from mass spectra, has emerged as a crucial approach in such cases. In recent years, deep learning has made significant strides in this domain. These methods train deep neural networks for translating mass spectra into peptide sequences without relying on any pre-constructed databases. Despite significant progress, this field still lacks a comprehensive and systematic review. In this paper, we provide the first review of deep learning-based \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing techniques from the perspectives of data types, model architectures, decoding strategies, applications and evaluation metrics. We also identify key challenges and highlight promising avenues for future research, providing a valuable resource for the AI and scientific communities.","Jun Xia, Jingbo Zhou, Shaorong Chen, Tianze Ling, Stan Z.

Evolution of Deep Learning Approaches in UAV-Based Crop Leaf Disease Detection: A Web of Science Review,"The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced crop disease detection by enabling scalable, high-resolution, and near real-time monitoring within precision agriculture. This systematic review analyzes peer-reviewed literature indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection as articles or proceeding papers through 2024. The main selection criterion was combining “unmanned aerial vehicle*” OR “UAV” OR “drone” with “deep learning”, “agriculture” and “leaf disease” OR “crop disease”. Results show a marked surge in publications after 2019, with China, the United States, and India leading research contributions. Multirotor UAVs equipped with RGB sensors are predominantly used due to their affordability and spatial resolution, while hyperspectral imaging is gaining traction for its enhanced spectral diagnostic capability. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), along with emerging transformer-based and hybrid models, demonstrate high detection performance, often achieving F1-scores above 95%. However, critical challenges persist, including limited annotated datasets for rare diseases, high computational costs of hyperspectral data processing, and the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks. Addressing these issues will require the development of lightweight DL architectures optimized for edge computing, improved multimodal data fusion techniques, and the creation of publicly available, annotated benchmark datasets. Advancements in these areas are vital for translating current research into practical, scalable solutions that support sustainable and data-driven agricultural practices worldwide.","Dorijan Radočaj, Petra Radocaj, I.

Robust Face Recognition Under Challenging Conditions: A Comprehensive Review of Deep Learning Methods and Challenges,"The paper critically reviews face recognition models that are based on deep learning, specifically security and surveillance. Existing systems are susceptible to pose variation, occlusion, low resolution and even aging, even though they perform quite well under controlled conditions. The authors make a systematic review of four state-of-the-art architectures—FaceNet, ArcFace, OpenFace and SFace—through the use of five benchmark datasets, namely LFW, CPLFW, CALFW, AgeDB-30 and QMUL-SurvFace. The measures of performance are evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC), accuracy, precision and F1-score. The results reflect that FaceNet and ArcFace achieve the highest accuracy under well-lit and frontal settings; when comparing SFace, this proved to have better robustness to degraded and low-resolution surveillance images. This shows the weaknesses of traditional embedding methods because bigger data sizes reduce the performance of OpenFace with all of the datasets. These results underscore the main point of this study: a comparative study of the models in difficult real life conditions and the observation of the trade-off between generalization and specialization inherent to any models. Specifically, the ArcFace and FaceNet models are optimized to perform well in constrained settings and SFace in the wild ones. This means that the selection of models must be closely monitored with respect to deployment contexts, and future studies should focus on the study of architectures that maintain performance even with fluctuating conditions in the form of the hybrid architectures.","Aidana Zhalgas, B.

Applications of deep learning into supply chain management: a systematic literature review and a framework for future research,"In today's complex and ever-changing world, Supply Chain Management (SCM) is increasingly becoming a cornerstone to any company to reckon with in this global era for all industries. The rapidly growing interest in the application of Deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) in SCM, has urged the need for an up-to-date systematic review on the research development. The main purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive vision by reviewing a set of 43 papers about applications of Deep Learning (DL) methods to the SCM, as well as the trends, perspectives, and potential research gaps. This review uses content analysis to answer three research questions namely: 1- What SCM problems have been solved by the use of DL techniques? 2- What DL algorithms have been used to solve these problems? 3- What alternative algorithms have been used to tackle the same problems? And do DL outperform these methods and through which evaluation metrics? This review also responds to this call by developing a conceptual framework in a value-adding perspective that provides a full picture of areas on where and how DL can be applied within the SCM context. This makes it easier to identify potential applications to corporations, in addition to potential future research areas to science. It might also provide businesses a competitive advantage over their competitors by allowing them to add value to their data by analyzing it quickly and precisely.

Application and theory gaps during the rise of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"Considering the increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the absence of a comprehensive review on it, this research aims to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of influential AIEd studies. We analyzed 45 articles in terms of annual distribution, leading journals, institutions, countries/regions, the most frequently used terms, as well as theories and technologies adopted. We also evaluated definitions of AIEd from broad and narrow perspectives and clarified the relationship among AIEd, Educational Data Mining, Computer-Based Education, and Learning Analytics. Results indicated that: 1) there was a continuingly increasing interest in and impact of AIEd research; 2) little work had been conducted to bring deep learning technologies into educational contexts; 3) traditional AI technologies, such as natural language processing were commonly adopted in educational contexts, while more advanced techniques were rarely adopted, 4) there was a lack of studies that both employ AI technologies and engage deeply with educational theories. Findings suggested scholars to 1) seek the potential of applying AI in physical classroom settings; 2) spare efforts to recognize detailed entailment relationships between learners’ answers and the desired conceptual understanding within intelligent tutoring systems; 3) pay more attention to the adoption of advanced deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial network and deep neural network; 4) seek the potential of NLP in promoting precision or personalized education; 5) combine biomedical detection and imaging technologies such as electroencephalogram, and target at issues regarding learners’ during the learning process; and 6) closely incorporate the application of AI technologies with educational theories.","Xieling Chen, Haoran Xie, D.

"VISUAL INSPECTION OF RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE BASED ON DEEP LEARNING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF METHODS, MODELS, AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES","In this paper, we present a review of the latest deep learning methods used in inspecting railway infrastructure with vision systems. Traditional methods for inspecting railways are not always efficient, scalable or accurate, so using computer vision and artificial intelligence is now needed to maintain rail safety. The research divides more than 200 papers into important themes, covering rail surface fault detection, issues with fasteners and sleepers, adding synthetic data, using different types of railroad sites and multi-technology integration. For every domain, we cover current progressive models, for example, CNNs, YOLOv5, U-Net, Faster R-CNN and Vision Transformers, discussing their uses, pros and cons. The problem of using the model in practice is analyzed by studying generalization, instant results, understanding how it learns and the hardware limitations. We also find areas where progress is needed and suggest future solutions to reduce the difference between what academic discovery and what industries can use.","Gulsipat Abisheva, Bibigul Razakhova, T.

Transformer-based Architecture for Assisting Title and Abstract Screening of a Systematic Review,"Systematic literature reviews are crucial for decision-making across various fields. Typically, these reviews are carried out using laborious manual methods that rely on, e.g. keyword searches, title, and text analysis. Their outcome is a thematic classification of papers. To alleviate the burden on scientists, several natural language processing-based approaches have been developed to facilitate the screening of papers.Our approach employs pre-trained transformer models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), LITMC-BERT and PubMedBERT, for papers about artificial intelligence research on COVID-19 for the purposes of detection, diagnosis, and prediction. This subject has been growing rapidly over the past three years, thereby making it challenging to be up-to-date with the latest information pertaining to the virus. Furthermore, with the COVID-19 situation appearing to have become more stable, scientists are focusing on investigating the underlying factors that caused the outbreak of the contagion.Our models find relevant documents and categorize them according to their information on COVID-19, such as diseases, treatments, and vaccinations. The proposed models have been evaluated for screening performance using a test set that comprises articles retrieved from the searches of three independent reviewers, who have assessed the eligibility of each paper. Our approach has achieved promising results for researchers and demonstrated its ability to be generalized.","M. Canaparo, S.C. Todeschini, E.

A synthesized framework for the formation of startups’ innovation ecosystem,"Purpose
The purpose of this study set out to introduce an alternative framework for explaining the formation of the innovation ecosystem based on the systematic literature review (SLR) and ecosystemic approach.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper is an SLR of studies from the year 2008-2018 that investigating startups’ innovation. SLR approach being used exploration, interpretation and communication method, which composed of seven steps as follows exploring topics, searching, organizing, evaluating and expanding, integrating and communicating. The output of this process is 63 documents that applied to synthesize the formation framework.
Findings
The systematic review of literature has shown that researchers in recent years have considered some entities such as incubators, financials suppliers, accelerators, universities and companies in relation to the startup innovations, which are described in this paper as key actors. The study of the relationship between these actors in the documents led to the identification of interactional necessities, including structures, infrastructures and networks. Finally, the processes studied in the literature were classified into three types of mechanisms, namely, the genesis, growth and development of startups innovations.
Research limitations/implications
The SLR approach is subject to limitations because some poor explanations amongst previous researchers may be repeated and reinforced. Also, in the protocol adopted in this paper, documents are limited in English.
Practical implications
The introduced frammework can be useful in identifying and understanding the requirements of startups and creating effective policies for their innovation development.
Originality/value
This paper reviews, summarizes and integrates the growing and scattered literature of the innovation ecosystem of the startups and delivers new facts for the future development of this field.","H.

Transformers based Deep Learning in Recommendation Systems: A Comprehensive Review,"In recent years, recommendation systems have become vital for businesses to enhance customer satisfaction and generate revenue across various domains, such as e-commerce and entertainment. Deep learning techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of these systems. However, there is a lack of comprehensive literature reviews that classify and summarize the latest deep learning techniques used in recommendation systems. Additionally, some existing review papers either overlook state-of-the-art techniques or focus narrowly on specific domains. To address these research gaps, this systematic review comprehensively analyzes the literature on deep learning techniques in recommendation systems, specifically employing term classification. The study highlights the emerging research area of domain classification, which has shown promising results in applying deep learning techniques to domains such as social networks, e-commerce, and e-learning. This review offers insights into the deep learning techniques used across different recommendation systems and provides suggestions for future research.
